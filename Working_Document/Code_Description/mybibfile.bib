@article{Lindauer1999,
abstract = {We investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP in the coupling of neuronal activation to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. Whisker deflection (60 s) increased rCBF by 18 +/- 3\%. NO synthase (NOS) inhibition by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; topically) reduced the rCBF response to 9 +/- 4\% and resting rCBF to 80 +/- 8\%. NO donors [S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; 50 microM), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (10 microM)] or 8-bromoguanosine 3', 5'-cyclic-monophosphate (8-BrcGMP; 100 microM)] restored resting rCBF and L-NNA-induced attenuation of the whisker response in the presence of L-NNA, whereas the NO-independent vasodilator papaverine (1 mM) had no effect on the whisker response. Basal cGMP levels were decreased to 35\% by L-NNA and restored to 65\% of control by subsequent SNAP superfusion. Inhibition of neuronal NOS by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 40 mg/kg ip) or soluble guanylyl cyclase by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 100 microM) significantly reduced resting rCBF to 86 +/- 8 and 92 +/- 10\% and whisker rCBF response to 7 +/- 4 and 12 +/- 3\%, respectively. ODQ reduced tissue cGMP to 54\%. 8-BrcGMP restored the whisker response in the presence of 7-NI or ODQ. We conclude that NO, produced by neuronal NOS, is a modulator in the coupling of neuronal activation and rCBF in rat somatosensory cortex and that this effect is mainly mediated by cGMP. L-NNA-induced vasomotion was significantly reduced during increased neuronal activity and after restoration of basal NO levels, but not after restoration of cGMP.},

@article{Hamel2006,
abstract = {Brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity, is commonly used to monitor normal or pathological brain function, and is a direct reflection of the interactions that occur between neuronal signals and blood vessels. Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.},

abstract = {In contrast to traditional neuroncentric views of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent findings indicate that neurovascular dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD. Here, I propose the neurovascular hypothesis of AD, suggesting that faulty clearance of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), aberrant angiogenesis and senescence of the cerebrovascular system could initiate neurovascular uncoupling, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion and neurovascular inflammation. Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A beta clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis.},

	branches and bifurcations. The focus of the present study is understanding
	how pulsatile flow effects mass transfer, observing both mean and
	transient variations. Unlike in the many idealized models which model
	transport of low diffusion coefficient species, the realistic geometry
	leads to very different mass transfer characteristics. These include
	spiral patterns in the distribution of low concentration fluid. Furthermore,
	the mean ATP distribution was found to be elevated compared with
	the steady state; this is attributed to the effects of convective
	mixing. The results strongly implicate that under certain conditions
	mass transport in pulsatile flow exhibits different hydrolysis characteristics
	at the endothelium compared with steady state. Transient variations
	throughout the the cardiac cycle were found to be small. This small
	transient response is primarily due to low ATP diffusivity.},

  abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction is controlled by the Ca2+ and
	Rho kinase signalling pathways. While the SMC Rho kinase system seems
	to be reasonably constant, there is enormous variation with regard
	to the mechanisms responsible for generating Ca2+ signals. One way
	of dealing with this diversity is to consider how this system has
	been adapted to control different SMC functions. Phasic SMCs (vas
	deferens, uterus and bladder) rely on membrane depolarization to
	drive Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This depolarization
	can be induced by neurotransmitters or through the operation of a
	membrane oscillator. Many tonic SMCs (vascular, airway and corpus
	cavernosum) are driven by a cytosolic Ca2+ oscillator that generates
	periodic pulses of Ca2+. A similar oscillator is present in pacemaker
	cells such as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and atypical
	SMCs that control other tonic SMCs (gastrointestinal, urethra, ureter).
	The changes in membrane potential induced by these cytosolic oscillators
	does not drive contraction directly but it functions to couple together
	individual oscillators to provide the synchronization that is a characteristic
	feature of many tonic SMCs.},

	by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional
	increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process
	known as "neurovascular coupling"--the orchestrated communication
	system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps
	in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the
	release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into
	the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts
	for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable
	of simulating the approximate 15\% arteriolar dilation caused by
	a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and
	glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully
	emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction
	follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or
	perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest
	that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane
	potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential
	of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate
	that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially
	important for successful neurovascular coupling.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle
	cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric
	arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology;
	(b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR);
	(c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3
	and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide
	(NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization
	and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau.
	The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation
	of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in
	[Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model
	simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the
	Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation
	of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl
	initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period.
	The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+
	release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated
	SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated
	K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can
	result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing
	resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE.
	Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects.
	We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components
	yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some
	of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest
	a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics
	and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation,
	and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis
	for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will
	investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

	Many muscular vessels present vasomotion, i.e., rhythmic diameter

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

@article{David2001,
abstract = {A mathematical and numerical model is developed for the adhesion of platelets in stagnation point flow. The model provides for a correct representation of the axi-symmetric flow and explicitly uses shear rate to characterise not only the convective transport but also the simple surface reaction mechanism used to model platelet adhesion at the wall surface. Excellent agreement exists between the analytical solution and that obtained by the numerical integration of the full Navier--Stokes equations and decoupled conservation of species equations. It has been shown that for a constant wall reaction rate modelling platelet adhesion the maximum platelet flux occurs at the stagnation point streamline. This is in direct contrast to that found in experiment where the maximum platelet deposition occurs at some distance downstream of the stagnation point. However, if the wall reaction rate is chosen to be dependent on the wall shear stress then the analysis shows that the maximum platelet flux occurs downstream of the stagnation point, providing a more realistic model of experimental evidence. The analytical formulation is applicable to a large number of two-dimensional and axi-symmetrical surface reaction flows where the wall shear stress is known a priori.},
