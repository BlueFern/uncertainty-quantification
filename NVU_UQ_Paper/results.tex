\subsection{Parameter distribution}
\label{sec:param_sampling}

Applying the methodology described in Section~\ref{sec:param_dist_fit}, $S=919$ parameter samples are drawn and \eqref{caboodle} is solved for each sample with no stimulus applied. Of these 919 runs, 670 of them fail due to ode15s terminating prematurely because its time steps became too small. The remaining 249 yields 139 solutions for which the radius reaches a stable steady state (at least for the duration of the time integration) and 110 solutions for which the radius reaches a steady state but subsequently because transient. The left panel of Figure~\ref{steady_states} displays four representative solutions for the radius; the red curves remain in steady state for the duration of our time integration whereas the black curves revert into a transit regime after some time in or near steady state. The right panel of Figure~\ref{steady_states} displays the samples for two parameters (in the buffer equation) which are found to be highly influential in determining the behavior of the solution. A blue \textcolor{blue}{*} indicates a sample where the solver terminated prematurely, a yellow \textcolor{yellow}{$\Diamond$} indicates a sample where an unstable steady state was observed, a red \textcolor{red}{$\circ$} indicates a sample where the solution remained in steady state. A strong correlation determining the behavior of the solution is observed. The two parameters in question, denoted by ($p_1,p_2$), occur in the buffer equation
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:buff}
[K^+]_e+B \quad\begin{array}{c}
f_f \\ 
 \rightleftharpoons \\
f_r
\end{array} 
[K^+]_b \nonumber \\
\frac{d[K^+]_b}{dt}=f_f[K^+]_e(b_0-[K^+]_b)-f_r[K^+]_b \nonumber \\
f_f=\frac{f_r}{1+exp(\frac{-[K^+]_e+p_1}{p_2})}
\end{eqnarray}
The parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$ have values 5.5 and 1.09, representing a shift and scaling in the rate constant respectively.

\caption{Left: examples of stable (red) and unstable (black) steady state solutions. Right: samples of the buffer parameters using uniform independent sampling. A blue \textcolor{blue}{*} indicates the sample yielded a premature termination of the solver, a yellow \textcolor{yellow}{$\Diamond$} indicates the sample yielded an unstable steady state, a red \textcolor{red}{$\circ$} indicates the sample yielded a stable steady state.}
\label{steady_states}
\end{figure}

Observing this correlation, we use the accepted samples to fit the two buffer parameters with a bivariate Frank copula with beta marginals. The experiment is repeated by sampling the two correlated parameters from this bivariate distribution and all other parameter from their original uniform distributions. After four iterations refining the joint distribution of $(p_1,p_2)$, we were able to generate 902 out of 960 samples which yielded solutions with stable steady states (51 solutions had unstable steady states and 7 had premature solver terminations). This fitted distribution is used for all subsequent analysis. 

Samples are drawn and the model, with a stimulus applied (in two separate cases, the 10 second rectangular pulse and the 16 second stimulus from experimental data), is run for each sample. This results in solutions exhibiting three different physiological regimes; they are displayed in Figure~\ref{solution_regimes} where the radius is plotted as a function of time. The leftmost panel corresponds to the typical case when the radius increases in response to the stimulus and then decreases when it is removed; the center panel corresponds to an atypical case where the radius has an initial decrease in response to the stimulus; the right panel corresponds to another atypical case where the radius reaches another steady state an does not decrease after the stimulus is removed.

\label{solution_regimes}
\end{figure}

This article focuses on the typical case so we remove samples where the radius does not increase in response to the stimulus and decrease when it is removed. This processing yields 660 samples for analysis when the rectangular pulse stimulus is applied and 438 samples when the stimulus from experimental data is applied. The results presented below use these samples.

Exploration of the 660 retained samples indicate that atypical cases have higher probability when the parameter which shifts the activation variable for the \pot flux through the soma KDR channel is reduced;
 however, this parameter does not characterize the solution regime by itself; it is likely that the solution regime is characterized by a combination of several parameters. Further sampling and exploration is required to better understand the structure in parameter space which determine the solution regime.



\subsection{ECS $K^+_{mean}$}
\label{sec:qoi_K_ECS_Mean}

Figure~\ref{fig:K_ECS_Mean_rect} and ~\ref{fig:K_ECS_Mean_exp} display results for the average of the ECS potassium as defined in equation (\ref{K_ECS_Mean}) for the rectangular pulse stimulus and experimental pulse stimulus respectively. In the top left panels, predictions of the linear surrogate are plotted against the model values. The sensitivities $L_j$, $j=1,2,\dots,160$, are displayed in the top right panels. Predictions of the PC surrogate are plotted against the model values in the bottom left panels. The total Sobol' indices of the PC surrogate are given in the bottom right panels.

In both cases, Table~\ref{tab:K_ECS_Mean} reports the five most important parameters and their total Sobol' indices.

\label{tab:K_ECS_Mean}
\end{table}
The top two values in Table \ref{tab:K_ECS_Mean} are scaling and shift parameters for the activation gating variable in the dendrite NaP channel respectively, whose ODE is defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:m4}
\frac{dm_4}{dt}=m_{4 \alpha}(1-m_4)-m_{4 \beta}m_4, \nonumber \\
m_{4 \alpha}=  \frac{1}{6(1 + exp(-(c_1  v_d + c_2)))},\nonumber \\
m_{4 \beta}= \frac{exp(-(c_1 v_d + c_2))}{6(1 + exp(-(c_1 v_d + c_2)))}.
\end{eqnarray}
The parameters $c_1$ and $c_2$ in \eqref{eqn:m4} correspond to the parameters indexed as 62 and 63 in the results, their nominal values are 0.143 and 5.67, respectively. These effectively define the characteristic time scale and forcing function in the rate equation for the open  probability of the persistent sodium channel. The third most important parameter determines the strength of the  conductance in the \pot leak ion channel. The fourth parameter (parameter index 75), denoted as $c_3$ below, is the shift of the neuron membrane potential in the ODE for the activation variable for the  K flux through dendritic KDR channel, defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:m6}
m_{6  \alpha}     = 0.016 \left(\frac{v_d + c_3}{1 - exp(-(0.2 * v_d + 0.2c_3))} \right), 
\end{eqnarray}
where the nominal value of $c_3$ is 34.9. As noted above this parameter provides for atypical cases having higher probability when the parameter value is reduced. The final parameter in Table \ref{tab:K_ECS_Mean} is small but corresponds to the assumed half-length of the dendrite. This is not unexpected as the longer the dendrite the larger the total ion flux. 

The results for this specific QoI are similar for both the rectangular pulse and experimental data stimulus. In both cases, the QoI is approximated with reasonable accuracy by a linear model and with higher accuracy by the PC model. The most important parameters are shared in both cases. Notice that parameter $p_1$, defined in \eqref{eqn:buff}, appears to be important in the linear model but unimportant in the PC model. This is because it is strongly correlated with parameter $p_2$ (also defined in defined in \eqref{eqn:buff}), see Figure~\ref{steady_states}, and as a result the coefficient in linear surrogate may be very large because its effect is offset by the effect of $p_2$. To decorrelate inputs, the PC surrogate is build with only $p_1$ instead of both $p_1$ and $p_2$. It subsequently has minimal importance.

The remaining two QoIs also present very similar results for both the rectangular pulse and experimental data stimulus. In the interest of conciseness, we only present figures corresponding to the experimental data stimulus for these two QoIs; Tables~\ref{tab:qoi_vol_flow} and ~\ref{tab:qoi_AM_AMp_Min} give results for both stimuli. 

\subsection{Volumetric Flow Rate}
Figure~\ref{fig:qoi_vol_flow_exp} displays results for the volumetric flow rate in the cerebral tissue defined by (\ref{vol_flow})  in the same manner as Figures~\ref{fig:K_ECS_Mean_rect} and \ref{fig:K_ECS_Mean_exp}. The results correspond to the experimental data stimulus.  Table~\ref{tab:qoi_vol_flow} reports the five most important parameters and their total Sobol' indices. Unsurprisingly, the parameter list contains values found in the SMC/EC compartment of the full model. However, the topmost parameter, $z_4$, is associated with the conductance of the inwardly rectifying SMC KIR channel, $g_{KIR}$, defined as a function of both membrane potential $v_{SMC}$ and the \pot concentration in the perivascular space $[K^+]_{PVS}$, given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
g_{KIR}=exp\left( z_5 v_{SMC}+z_3[K^+]_{PVS}-z_4\right)  \label{eqn:gkir}
\end{eqnarray}
as shown in \cite{Dormanns2015} fitting to the data of \cite{Filosa2006}. $z_4$ shifts the conductance to the right for constant $[K^+]_{PVS}$  concentration in the perivascular space whilst $n_{cross}$ (found in the wallmechanics section of the model) determines the strength of influence of cytosolic $[Ca^{2+}]$ in determining the reaction rate of phosphorylation of myosin \cite{Hai1988}. Although not especially important, $z_2$ shifts the Nernst potential for the KIR channel to the right in the equation
\begin{eqnarray}
v_{KIR}=z_1 [K^+]_{PVS}-z_2. \label{vkir}
\end{eqnarray}

\end{figure}

We again observe reasonably accurate fits by a linear surrogate and improved accuracy by a PC surrogate. The surrogate predictions and important parameters for the rectangular pulse and experimental stimulus closely agree. The influential parameters for the volumetric flow rate in the cerebral tissue are different than those found to be influential for the ECS potassium; an unsurprising result. As in Subsection~\ref{sec:qoi_K_ECS_Mean}, parameter $p_1$ appears important in the linear surrogate but unimportant in the PC surrogate.

\subsection{$[AM+AM_p]_{min}$}

Figure~\ref{fig:qoi_AM_AMp_Min_exp} displays results for the minimum of the combined concentration of the actin myosin complex with the experimental data stimulus. Table~\ref{tab:qoi_AM_AMp_Min} reports the five most important parameters (ranked by the total Sobol' indices for the rectangular pulse stimulus) and their total Sobol' indices. By comparing Table~\ref{tab:qoi_AM_AMp_Min} and Table~\ref{tab:qoi_vol_flow}, we see that the $[AM+AM_p]_{min}$ and volumetric flow rate QoIs share their four most important parameters. Although at first analysis this should not be surprising it does suggest that the reaction rates of the actin myosin model for vessel contraction/dilation are relatively insensitive to finding the minimum of the contraction force and that the KIR ion channel is a vital component of the model.

\label{fig:qoi_AM_AMp_Min_exp}
\end{figure}

The linear surrogate does not perform as well for this QoI; however, the PC surrogate is far more accurate; this highlights the nonlinearity of this particular QoI. The subset of parameters used in the PC surrogate differs for the rectangular pulse and experimental stimulus cases, but the most important parameters, as measured by the total Sobol' indices, agree. The most influential parameters for the minimum of the combined concentration of the actin myosin complex coincide with those for the volumetric flow rate in the cerebral tissue, an unsurprising result since both QoI are related to the wall mechanics. As in the previous results, parameter $p_1$ appears important in the linear surrogate but unimportant in the PC surrogate.
