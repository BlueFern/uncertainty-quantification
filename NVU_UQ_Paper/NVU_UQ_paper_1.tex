\section{INTRODUCTION}
During the last two decades \gls{fmri} has proven to be an established tool in studying the human brain. This is especially true in the case of the \gls{bold} signal, where changes in blood oxygen levels can be detected via the magnetic signal  \cite{Ogawa1990}. However due to the constraint on the resolution of \gls{bold}, \gls{fmri} methodology has not been used extensively to study the underlying cellular neural architecture and their associated cerebral functions. Complex models that address this important relationship and constructing a detailed compartmental model with the relevant cell types involved will allow simulations relating certain brain functions performed in a region to its \gls{fmri} \gls{bold} response. The \gls{nvc} mechanism, the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption, and the \gls{cbv} are known to contribute to the \gls{fmri} \gls{bold} response \citep{Buxton2004}, however a thorough understanding of these factors has yet to be fully established.

The \gls{nvc} response, the ability to locally adjust vascular resistance as a function of neuronal activity, is believed to be mediated by a number of different signalling mechanisms. \citet{Roy1890} first proposed a  mechanism based on a metabolic negative feedback theory. According to this theory, neural activity leads to a drop in oxygen or glucose levels and increases in CO$_2$, adenosine, and lactate levels. All of these signals could dilate arterioles and hence were believed to be part of the neurovascular response. However, recent experiments illustrated that the \gls{nvc} response is partially independent of these metabolic signals \citep{Leithner2010, Lindauer2010, Mintun2001, Powers1996, Makani2010}. An alternative to this theory was proposed where the neuron releases signalling molecules to directly or indirectly affect the blood flow. Many mechanisms such as the \gls{pot} signalling mechanism \cite{Filosa2006}, the \gls{no} signalling mechanism or the arachidonic acid to \gls{eet} pathway are found to contribute to the neurovascular response \citep{Attwell2010}.

The \gls{pot} signalling mechanism of \gls{nvc} seems to be supported by significant evidence, although new evidence shows that the endfoot astrocytic \gls{ca} could play a significant role. The \gls{pot} signalling hypothesis mainly utilises the astrocyte,  positioned to enable the communication between the neurons and the local perfusing blood vessels. The astrocyte and the \glspl{ec} surrounding the perfusing vessel lumen exhibit a striking similarity in ion channel expression and thus can enable control of the \gls{smc} from both the neuronal and blood vessel components \citep{Longden2015}. Whenever there is neuronal activation \gls{pot} ions are released into the \gls{ecs} and \gls{sc}. The astrocyte is depolarised by taking up \gls{pot} released by the neuron and releases it into the \gls{pvs} via the endfeet through the BK channels \citep{Filosa2007}. This increase in \gls{ecs} \gls{pot} concentration ($3-10$ mM) near the arteriole hyperpolarises the \gls{smc} through the \gls{kir} channel, effectively closing the voltage-gated \gls{ca} channel, reducing smooth muscle cytosolic \gls{ca} and thereby causing dilation. Higher \gls{pot} concentrations in the \gls{pvs} cause contraction due to the reverse flux of the \gls{kir} channel \citep{Farr2011}. 

Amidst the difficulty in monitoring and measuring the rapid changes in metabolic demands in the highly heterogeneous brain, speculative estimates of the relative demands of the cerebral processes that require energy were given based on different experimental data by \citet{Ames2000}. As per the estimate, the vegetative processes that maintain the homeostasis including protein synthesis accounted for $10-15$\% of the total energy consumption. The costliest function seems to be in  restoring the ionic gradients during neural activation. The \gls{sodpot} exchange pump is estimated to consume $40-50$\%, while the \gls{ca} influx from organelles and extracellular fluid consumes $3-7$\%. The processing of neurotransmitters such as uptake or synthesis consumes $10-20$\%, while the intracellular signalling systems which includes activation and inactivation of proteins consumes $20-30$\%. The rest of the energy is estimated to be consumed by the axonal and dendritic transport in both directions.

Previous work \cite{Mathias2018} has provided  the construction of an experimentally validated numerical (\textit{in silico}) model based on experimental data to simulate the \gls{fmri} \gls{bold} signal associated with \gls{nvc} along with the associated metabolic and blood volume responses. An existing neuron model \citep{Mathias2017, Mathias2017a} has been extended to include an additional transient \gls{na} ion channel (NaT) expressed in the neuron, and integrated into a complex \gls{nvc} model \citep{Dormanns2015, Dormanns2016, Kenny2017a}. This present model is based on the hypothesis that the \gls{pot} signalling mechanism of \gls{nvc} is the primary contributor to the vascular response and the \gls{sodpot} exchange pump in the neuron is the primary consumer of oxygen during neural activation. The model contains 160 parameters, most of which come from non-human experiments. \\
Such a complex model constructed with a high-dimensional parameter space is not easily amenable to sensitivity analyses considering the significant computing resource required. Indeed no formal theory exists which allows direct mathematical investigation of the variability of the large dimensional parameter vector and the resulting output. 
From a purely physiological perspective an understanding of the dominant cellular mechanisms resulting in cerebral tissue perfusion after neuronal stimulation would be of particular interest. \\
  
  We have used the \gls{cbf} change from the experimental data \cite{Zheng2010} taken from the rat barrel cortex. 
\section{Methodology}
The ODE system is solved using ode15s in Matlab with relative and absolute tolerances set too $10^{-4}$.
\subsection{QoIs}
We analyse 3 quantities of interest (QoIs) with respect to two different stimulations, a 10 second square stimulation pulse and a 16 second stimulus used in lab experiments. Assuming the stimulation occurs for $t_1\le t \le t_2$, the QoIs are defined are defined as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item ECS potassium has a distinct effect on the flux into the Neuron. Hence we look at the average.
\begin{eqnarray}
%[K^+]_{max,ECS} \label{K_ECS_Max} \\
 \frac{1}{t_2-t_1}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}[K^+]_{ECS}(s)ds \label{K_ECS_Mean}
\end{eqnarray}

\item As a representation of the volumetric flow rate in the cerebral tissue
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\left(\frac{R(s)}{R_0}\right)^4ds \label{vol_flow}
\end{equation}
 
%\item ECS potassium has a distinct effect on the flux into the astrocyte. Hence we look at the average and the maximum.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%[K^+]_{max,AC} \label{K_AC_Max} \\
%\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}[K^+]_{AC}(s)ds \label{K_AC_Mean}
%\end{eqnarray}
\item the combined concentration of the actin myosin complex, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated, determines the effect stress due to the contraction for the smooth muscle cell. 
\begin{eqnarray}
[AM+AM_p]_{min} \label{AM_AMp_Min}
\end{eqnarray}

%\item The phase lag between neuronal stimulation and the radius changed effects a number of markers. Notably the BOLD signal, hence we choose to investigate
% the time, $\tau$, to min value of $AM_p$
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \tau = t_{min}-t_1 \label{AMp_Time_to_Min}
% \end{eqnarray}
\end{enumerate}

In addition, we analysed the average concentration of AC potassium, but it exhibited very small variation with respect to the parameters so we do not report any additional results for this QoI.

\subsection{Surrogate models and Sobol' indices}
DESCRIBE THE SURROGATES AND SOBOL' INDICES

\section{Results}
This section details our approach to varying the parameters and contains numerical results for the 3 QoI's, with both the square pulse stimulus and the experimental data stimulus for each. The section is organized in four subsections, one on the parameter sampling and one for each of the three QoI's.

\subsection{Parameter sampling}
Parameter distributions are determined by first assuming independence of the parameters and assigning each parameter a uniform distribution with +- 10\% uncertainty around its nominal value. In really, some parameters are correlated but we do not know the correlation structure a priori. We attempt to run the model for 919 different parameter samples with no stimulus applied, i.e. simulating the steady state. Of these 919 runs, 670 of them fail due to ode15s terminating prematurely because its time steps became too small. The remaining 249 yields 139 solutions which the radius reaches a stable steady state (at least for the duration of the time integration) and 110 solutions for which the radius reaches a steady state but subsequently because transient. The left panel of Figure~\ref{steady_states} displays four representative solutions for the radius; the red curves remain in steady state for the duration of our time integration whereas the black curves revert into a transit regime after some time in or near steady state. The right panel of Figure~\ref{steady_states} displays the samples for two parameters which are highly influential in determining the behavior of the solution. The blue \*'s indicate samples where the solver terminated prematurely, the yellow +'s indicate samples where an unstable steady state was observed, the red $\circ$'s indicate samples where the solution remained in steady state. A very clear (and strong) correlation is observed between these parameters which has significant influence on the behavior of the solution.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Left: examples of stable (red) and unstable (black) steady state solutions. Right: samples of the buffer parameters using uniform independent sampling. A blue \* indicates the sample yielded a premature termination of the solver, a yellow + indicates the sample yielded an unstable steady state, a red $\circ$ indicates the sample yielded a stable steady state.}
\vspace{-.5 cm}
\label{steady_states}
\end{figure}

Having observed a clear structure in the parameter space, we use the samples which remained in steady state to fit a bivariate distribution with beta marginals and a Frank copula. The experiment was repeat by sampling the two correlated parameters with the bivariate distribution and all other parameter from their original uniform distributions. The samples yielding steady state solutions where collected, a bivariate distribution fit to them, and the experimented was repeated. After three additional iterations we were able to generate 902 out of 960 samples which yielded solutions with stable steady states (51 solutions had unstable steady states and 7 had premature solver terminations). This distribution is used for all subsequent analysis.

Having determined a reasonable parameter distribution by analyzing the steady state solutions, we sample from this distribution and run the model with a stimulus applied (in two separate cases, the 10 second rectangular pulse and the 16 second stimulus from experimental data). This results in solutions exhibiting three different physiological regimes; they are displayed in Figure~\ref{solution_regimes} where the radius is plotted as a function of time. The leftmost panel corresponds to the typical case when the radius increases in response to the stimulus; the center panel corresponds to an atypical case where the radius has an initial decrease in response to the stimulus; the right panel corresponds to another atypical case where the radius reaches another steady state an does not decrease after the stimulus is removed.

\label{solution_regimes}
\vspace{-.5 cm}
\end{figure}

This study focus on the typical case so we remove samples where the radius does not increase in response to the stimulus and decrease when it is removed. This processing yields 660 samples for analysis when the rectangular pulse stimulus is applied and 438 samples when the stimulus from experimental data is applied. The results presented below use these samples.
