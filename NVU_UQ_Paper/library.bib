Its role in neurovascular coupling (NVC) is discussed controversially and one of the main unanswered questions is which cell type provides the governing source of NO for the regulation of vasodynamics. Mathematical modelling can be an appropriate tool to investigate the contribution of NO towards the key components of NVC and analyse underlying mechanisms. The lumped parameter model of a neurovascular unit, including neurons (NE), astrocytes (AC), smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells (EC), was extended to model the NO signaling pathway. Results show that NO leads to a general shift of the resting regional blood flow by dilating the arteriolar radius. Furthermore, dilation during neuronal activation is enhanced. Simulations show that potassium release is responsible for the fast onset of vascular response, whereas NO-modulated mechanisms maintain dilation. Wall shear stress-activated NO release from the EC leads to a delayed return to the basal state of the arteriolar radius. The governing source of vasodilating NO that diffuses into the SMC, which determine the arteriolar radius, depends on neuronal activation. In the resting state the EC provides the major contribution towards vasorelaxation, whereas during neuronal stimulation NO produced by the NE dominates.},

abstract = {Sustained inward currents in neuronal membranes underlie tonic-clonic seizure discharges and spreading depression (SD). It is not known whether these currents flow through abnormally operating physiological ion channels or through pathological pathways that are not normally present. We have now used the NEURON simulating environment of Hines, Moore, and Carnevale to model seizure discharges and SD. The geometry and electrotonic properties of the model neuron conformed to a hippocampal pyramidal cell. Voltage-controlled transient and persistent sodium currents (I(Na,T) and I(Na,P)), potassium currents (I(K,DR) and I(K,A)), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-controlled currents (I(NMDA)), were inserted in the appropriate regions of the model cell. The neuron was surrounded by an interstitial space where extracellular potassium and sodium concentration ([K(+)](o) and [Na(+)](o)) could rise or fall. Changes in intra- and extracellular ion concentrations and the resulting shifts in the driving force for ionic currents were continuously computed based on the amount of current flowing through the membrane. A Na-K exchange pump operated to restore ion balances. In addition, extracellular potassium concentration, [K(+)](o), was also controlled by a "glial" uptake function. Parameters were chosen to resemble experimental data. As long as [K(+)](o) was kept within limits by the activity of the Na-K pump and the "glial" uptake, a depolarizing current pulse applied to the cell soma evoked repetitive firing that ceased when the stimulating current stopped. If, however, [K(+)](o) was allowed to rise, then a brief pulse provoked firing that outlasted the stimulus. At the termination of such a burst, the cell hyperpolarized and then slowly depolarized and another burst erupted without outside intervention. Such "clonic" bursting could continue indefinitely maintained by an interplay of the rise and fall of potassium and sodium concentrations with membrane currents and threshold levels. SD-like depolarization could be produced in two ways, 1) by a dendritic NMDA-controlled current. Glutamate was assumed to be released in response to rising [K(+)](o). And 2) by the persistent (i.e., slowly inactivating) Na-current, I(Na,P). When both I(NMDA) and I(Na,P) were present, the two acted synergistically. We conclude that epileptiform neuronal behavior and SD-like depolarization can be generated by the feedback of ion currents that change ion concentrations, which, in turn, influence ion currents and membrane potentials. The normal stability of brain function must depend on the efficient control of ion activities, especially that of [K(+)](o).},

@article{Jacobsen2007a,
	Abstract = {In vitro, alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation of rat mesenteric small arteries often leads to a rhythmic change in wall tension, i.e., vasomotion. Within the individual smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall, vasomotion is often preceded by a period of asynchronous calcium waves. Abruptly, these low-frequency waves may transform into high-frequency whole cell calcium oscillations. Simultaneously, multiple cells synchronize, leading to rhythmic generation of tension. We present a mathematical model of vascular smooth muscle cells that aims at characterizing this sudden transition. Simulations show calcium waves sweeping through the cytoplasm when the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is stimulated to release calcium. A rise in cGMP leads to the experimentally observed transition from waves to whole cell calcium oscillations. At the same time, membrane potential starts to oscillate and the frequency approximately doubles. In this transition, the simulated results point to a key role for a recently discovered cGMP-sensitive calcium-dependent chloride channel. This channel depolarizes the membrane in response to calcium released from the SR. In turn, depolarization causes a uniform opening of L-type calcium channels on the cell surface, stimulating a synchronized release of SR calcium and inducing the shift from waves to whole cell oscillations. The effect of the channel is therefore to couple the processes of the SR with those of the membrane. We hypothesize that the shift in oscillatory mode and the associated onset of oscillations in membrane potential within the individual cell may underlie sudden intercellular synchronization and the appearance of vasomotion.},

@article{Haddock2002,
	Abstract = {Spontaneous, rhythmical contractions, or vasomotion, can be recorded from cerebral vessels under both normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Using electrophysiology to study changes in membrane potential, the ratiometric calcium indicator Fura-2 AM to study changes in [Ca(2+)](i) in both the arterial wall and in individual smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and video microscopy to study changes in vessel diameter, we have investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying vasomotion in the juvenile rat basilar artery. During vasomotion, rhythmical oscillations in both membrane potential and [Ca(2+)](i) were found to precede rhythmical contractions. Nifedipine depolarized SMCs and abolished rhythmical contractions and depolarizations. [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in the arterial wall became reduced and irregular, while [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in adjacent SMCs were no longer synchronized. BAPTA-AM, thapsigargin and U73122 hyperpolarized SMCs, relaxed the vessel, decreased basal calcium levels and abolished vasomotion. Chloride substitution abolished rhythmical activity, depolarized SMCs, increased basal calcium levels and constricted the vessel, while niflumic acid and DIDS abolished vasomotion. Ryanodine, charybdotoxin and TRAM-34, but not iberiotoxin, 4-aminopyridine or apamin, each depolarized SMCs and increased the frequency of rhythmical depolarizations and [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. We conclude that vasomotion in the basilar artery depends on the release of intracellular calcium from IP(3) (inositol 1,4,5,-trisphosphate)-sensitive stores which activates calcium-dependent chloride channels to depolarize SMCs. Depolarization in turn activates voltage-dependent calcium channels, synchronizing contractions of adjacent cells through influx of extracellular calcium. Subsequent calcium-induced calcium release from ryanodine-sensitive stores activates an intermediate conductance potassium channel, hyperpolarizing the SMCs and providing a negative feedback pathway for regeneration of the contractile cycle.},

@article{Haydon2006,
	Abstract = {From a structural perspective, the predominant glial cell of the central nervous system, the astrocyte, is positioned to regulate synaptic transmission and neurovascular coupling: the processes of one astrocyte contact tens of thousands of synapses, while other processes of the same cell form endfeet on capillaries and arterioles. The application of subcellular imaging of Ca2+ signaling to astrocytes now provides functional data to support this structural notion. Astrocytes express receptors for many neurotransmitters, and their activation leads to oscillations in internal Ca2+. These oscillations induce the accumulation of arachidonic acid and the release of the chemical transmitters glutamate, d-serine, and ATP. Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytic endfeet can control cerebral microcirculation through the arachidonic acid metabolites prostaglandin E2 and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids that induce arteriole dilation, and 20-HETE that induces arteriole constriction. In addition to actions on the vasculature, the release of chemical transmitters from astrocytes regulates neuronal function. Astrocyte-derived glutamate, which preferentially acts on extrasynaptic receptors, can promote neuronal synchrony, enhance neuronal excitability, and modulate synaptic transmission. Astrocyte-derived d-serine, by acting on the glycine-binding site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, can modulate synaptic plasticity. Astrocyte-derived ATP, which is hydrolyzed to adenosine in the extracellular space, has inhibitory actions and mediates synaptic cross-talk underlying heterosynaptic depression. Now that we appreciate this range of actions of astrocytic signaling, some of the immediate challenges are to determine how the astrocyte regulates neuronal integration and how both excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory signals (adenosine) provided by the same glial cell act in concert to regulate neuronal function.},

@article{Shmuel2008,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated large amplitude spontaneous fluctuations in functional-MRI (fMRI) signals in humans in the resting state. Importantly, these spontaneous fluctuations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal are often synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon termed functional-connectivity. Functional-connectivity is widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of fluctuations in activity of the underlying neuronal networks. Despite the large body of human imaging literature on spontaneous activity and functional-connectivity in the resting state, the link to underlying neural activity remains tenuous. Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological recording, we demonstrate correlation between slow fluctuations in BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying locally measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with time-lag of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a traditional hemodynamic response function with peaks at approximately 6 s lag of BOLD signal. The correlations were reliably detected when the neuronal signal consisted of either the spiking rate of a small group of neurons, or relative power changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly in the local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation between the voxel-by-voxel fMRI time-series and the neuronal activity measured within one cortical site showed patterns of correlation that slowly traversed cortex. BOLD fluctuations in widespread areas in visual cortex of both hemispheres were significantly correlated with neuronal activity from a single recording site in V1. To the extent that our V1 findings can be generalized to other cortical areas, fMRI-based functional-connectivity between remote regions in the resting state can be linked to synchronization of slow fluctuations in the underlying neuronal signals.},

In 42{\%} of the slices the brief bursts evoked in CA1 gave way every 0.5-2 s to sustained ictal (or seizure) episode with tonic and clonic components. Paired intra- and extracellular recordings in the CA1 pyramidal layer were used to characterize the synaptic and nonsynaptic mechanisms generating the brief and sustained epileptiform events. The interictal, tonic, or clonic primary burst response in CA1 comprised a spindle-shaped, tight cluster (170-180 Hz) of five to seven population spikes. Bursts evoked between sequential seizures (interictal bursts) were initially small and progressively increased in size. Concurrently, basal extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o] increased from 6.5 to 7.5 mM. The tonic event emanated from a large primary burst and comprised prolonged ({\textgreater}1 s), self-sustained afterdischarge, associated with a rise in [K+]o to 12 mM. Bursts generated during the subsequent [K+]o decline (clonic bursts) also were large and followed by some afterdischarge. They became small during [K+]o undershoot to 6.5 mM. Intrinsically burst firing pyramidal cells (PCs) were recruited before or at the very onset of the primary population burst and fired repetitively during its course. Nonbursters were recruited {\textgreater}or = 10 ms after the beginning of the primary burst and fired, on average, only one spike. The PCs depolarized during the primary burst and subsequent afterdischarge. The primary depolarizing shift was larger in bursters than in nonbursters. Both bursters and nonbursters fired repetitively, albeit intermittently, during tonic and clonic afterdischarge. Throughout the interictal-ictal cycle intracellular spikes were time-locked to population spikes, indicating that PCs fire in tight synchrony. Differential recording of transmembrane potentials unmasked rapid (4-7 ms) transmembrane depolarizing potentials of up to 10 mV, coincident with population spikes. We conclude that in the high-K+ model of hippocampal epilepsy, the local generation of population bursts in CA1 is led by intrinsic bursters, which recruit and synchronize other PCs by synaptic, electrical, and K(+)-mediated excitatory interactions. The cycling between interictal, tonic, and clonic events appears to result from feedback interactions between neuronal discharge and [K+]o.},

	Abstract = {The integrative properties of neurons depend strongly on the number, proportions and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs they receive. In this study the three-dimensional geometry of dendritic trees and the density of symmetrical and asymmetrical synapses on different cellular compartments of rat hippocampal CA1 area pyramidal cells was measured to calculate the total number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on a single cell. A single pyramidal cell has ∼12,000{\$}\mu{\$}m dendrites and receives around 30,000 excitatory and 1700 inhibitory inputs, of which 40{\%} are concentrated in the perisomatic region and 20{\%} on dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The pre- and post-synaptic features suggest that CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites are heterogeneous. Strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are similar and differ from stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites. Proximal apical and basal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are spine-free or sparsely spiny. Distal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites (forming 68.5{\%} of the pyramidal cells' dendritic tree) are densely spiny; their excitatory inputs terminate exclusively on dendritic spines, while inhibitory inputs target only dendritic shafts. The proportion of inhibitory inputs on distal spiny strata radiatum and oriens dendrites is low (∼3{\%}). In contrast, proximal dendritic segments receive mostly (70--100{\%}) inhibitory inputs. Only inhibitory inputs innervate the somata (77--103 per cell) and axon initial segments. Dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare possess moderate to small amounts of spines. Excitatory synapses on stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites are larger than the synapses in other layers, are frequently perforated (∼40{\%}) and can be located on dendritic shafts. Inhibitory inputs, whose percentage is relatively high (∼14--17{\%}), also terminate on dendritic spines. Our results indicate that: (i) the highly convergent excitation arriving onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells is primarily controlled by proximally located inhibition; (ii) the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in layers receiving Schaffer collateral input (radiatum/oriens) versus perforant path input (lacunosum-moleculare) is significantly different.},

	Abstract = {The temporal evolution of irreversible neuronal damage from pilocarpine- induced seizures was studied by light microscopy. Neuronal cell death was judged on a 0-3 scale by estimating the percentage of acidophilic neurons in each of 23 brain regions. In addition, in the dorsal dentate hilus (CA4), quantitative cell counts of normal and acidophilic neurons were also performed. A few dead neurons (grade 0.5 damage) appeared in ventral hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions after 20-min status epilepticus (SE). Slight- to-mild damage (grades 0.5-1.5) occurred in 14 and 12 brain regions after 40- min and 1-h SE respectively, and slight-to-moderate damage (grades 0.5-2.0) was found in 15 regions after 3-h SE. Twenty-four h and 72 h after 3-h SE, there was slight-to-severe damage (grade 0.5-3.0) in 22 and 21 regions respectively. Three-h SE produced more severe damage to 7 brain regions compared to 1-h SE, and 16 regions had more pronounced neuronal injury 24 h after rather than 0-4 h after 3-h SE. Eight brain regions had less damage 72 h compared to 24 h after SE, probably because of progressive neuronal lysis and dropout, but in mediodorsal and lateroposterior thalamic nuclei damage worsened from 24 to 72 h after SE. Neuronal cell counting revealed 20{\%} acidophilic neurons in dorsal dentate hilus after 40-min SE and no difference between the 1-h and 3-h seizure groups (31{\%} vs. 43{\%} acidophilic neurons respectively). Among the 3 groups of rats with 3-h SE and varying recovery periods, the 24-h and 72-h recovery groups had higher percentages of acidophilic neurons (65{\%} and 54{\%} respectively) than the 0-4-h group (43{\%}). Finally, the hippocampal CA2 region and dentate granule cell layer and the caudate-putamen, considered resistant to seizure-induced cell injury, were all damaged from SE lasting 40 rain or more.},

	Abstract = {Spreading depression (SD) is a wave-like phenomenon that spreads through the gray matter of central nervous tissue. The aim of this work is to investigate how cellular energy supply and nitric oxide (NO) influence the recovery period after SD wave propagation. We have examined the SD wave in chicken retina by registration of the intrinsic optical signal (IOS). The changes of the IOS were observed via a microscope, transferred to a photomultiplier and amplified. The IOS of the SD wave consists of two phases. The first phase of IOS coexists with cellular swelling induced by ion distribution; the second phase is thought to reflect metabolic changes and reflects the refractory (recovery) period. To analyze the IOS, the amplitude, the duration and the front and the back maximal slopes of the both phases were analyzed. To reduce the cellular level of ATP the blocker of glucose transport-dexamethasone (glucocorticoid hormone) and the blocker of the respiratory chain-potassium cyanide were used. Sodium nitroprusside and trinitroglycerine were chosen as NO-donors. Our results show that during and after SD wave propagation (i) increased NO concentration changes the first and the second phases of IOS (duration of both phases is NO independent), (ii) reduced glucose uptake leads to an increased second phase duration and (iii) block of the respiratory chain prolongs the first phase. According to the results here presented, we propose that glycogen synthesis is one of the mechanisms reflected by the second phase of the IOS.},

	Abstract = {Endothelial function refers to a multitude of physiological processes that maintain healthy homeostasis of the vascular wall. Exposure of the endothelium to cardiac risk factors results in endothelial dysfunction and is associated with an alteration in the balance of vasoactive substances produced by endothelial cells. These include a reduction in nitric oxide (NO), an increase in generation of potential vasoconstrictor substances and a potential compensatory increase in other mediators of vasodilation. The latter has been surmised from data demonstrating persistent endothelium-dependent vasodilatation despite complete inhibition of NO and prostaglandins. This remaining non-NO, non-prostaglandin mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilator response has been attributed to endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor/s (EDHF). Endothelial hyperpolarization is likely due to several factors that appear to be site and species specific. Experimental studies suggest that the contribution of the EDHFs increase as the vessel size decreases, with a predominance of EDHF activity in the resistance vessels, and a compensatory up-regulation of hyperpolarization in states characterized by reduced NO availability. Since endothelial dysfunction is a precursor for atherosclerosis development and its magnitude is a reflection of future risk, then the mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction need to be fully understood, so that adequate therapeutic interventions can be designed.},

	Abstract = {Oscillating levels of adrenal glucocorticoid hormones are essential for optimal gene expression, and for maintaining physiological and behavioural responsiveness to stress. The biological basis for these oscillations is not known, but a neuronal "pulse generator" within the hypothalamus has remained a popular hypothesis. We demonstrate that pulsatile hypothalamic activity is not required for generating ultradian glucocorticoid oscillations. We show that a constant level of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) can activate a dynamic pituitary-adrenal peripheral network to produce ultradian adrenocorticotrophic hormone and glucocorticoid oscillations with a physiological frequency. This oscillatory response to CRH is dose dependent and becomes disrupted for higher levels of CRH. These data suggest that glucocorticoid oscillations result from a sub-hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal system, which functions as a deterministic peripheral hormone oscillator with a characteristic ultradian frequency. This constitutes a novel mechanism by which the level, rather than the pattern, of CRH determines the dynamics of glucocorticoid hormone secretion.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide is a soluble gas continuously synthesized by the endothelium. This substance has a wide range of biological properties that maintain vascular homeostasis, including modulation of vascular dilator tone, regulation of local cell growth, and protection of the vessel from injurious consequences of platelets and cells circulating in blood. A growing list of conditions, including those commonly associated as risk factors for atherosclerosis such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, are associated with diminished release of nitric oxide into the arterial wall either because of impaired synthesis or excessive oxidative degradation. Diminished nitric oxide bioactivity may cause constriction of coronary arteries during exercise or during mental stress and contribute to provocation of myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Additionally, diminished nitric oxide bioactivity may facilitate vascular inflammation that could lead to oxidation of lipoproteins and foam cell formation, the precursor of the atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous therapies have been investigated to assess the possibility of reversing endothelial dysfunction by enhancing the release of nitric oxide from the endothelium, either through stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis or protection of nitric oxide from oxidative inactivation and conversion to toxic molecules such as peroxynitrite. Accordingly, causal relationships between improved endothelial function and reduction in myocardial ischemia and acute coronary events can now be investigated.},

@article{Dupont2011,
	Abstract = {In parallel with experimental investigations, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ oscillations have been much investigated with computational models. In the vast majority of cell-types, these oscillations rely on the biphasic regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP 3) receptor by cytosolic Ca2+. However, when Ca 2+ oscillations are initiated by agonist stimulation of the type 5 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu5) receptor, oscillatory behaviour is tightly controlled by repetitive cycles of receptor phosphorylation/dephosphorylation leading to the periodic activation/deactivation of the G protein-activated signalling cascade downstream of this G protein-coupled receptor. We present a minimal model for mGlu5 receptor-induced Ca2+ oscillations, taking into account receptor phosphorylation by a protein kinase C isoenzyme sensitive to diacylglycerol but not to Ca2+. Depending on the density of receptors and the level of stimulation, the model reproduces Ca2+ oscillations based on either a 'dynamic uncoupling' mechanism or InsP 3 receptor dynamics. When based on the former mechanism, Ca 2+ oscillation frequency is insensitive to the level of stimulation, while the level of receptor expression is a determinant of oscillation frequency. When investigating the conditions for the occurrence of oscillations, the model predicts that dynamic uncoupling likely relies on a steep relationship between the activity of PKC and the amount of phosphorylated mGlu5 receptor. Finally, we use the model to simulate the adaptation of the signalling pathway during periods of prolonged stimulation associated with receptor desensitization/internalization. The model suggests that the existence of both oscillatory mechanisms could allow for a significant lengthening of the repetitive Ca2+ responses under these conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

	Abstract = {The amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia and impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cerebral vessels. We investigated whether cerebrovascular autoregulation, i.e., the ability of the cerebral circulation to maintain flow in the face of changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), is impaired in transgenic mice that overexpress APP and A beta. Neocortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized APP(+) and APP(-) mice. MAP was elevated by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine and reduced by controlled exsanguination. In APP(-) mice, autoregulation was preserved. However, in APP(+) mice, autoregulation was markedly disrupted. The magnitude of the disruption was linearly related to brain A beta concentration. The failure of autoregulation was paralleled by impairment of the CBF response to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. Thus A beta disrupts a critical homeostatic mechanism of the cerebral circulation and renders CBF highly dependent on MAP. The resulting alterations in cerebral perfusion may play a role in the brain dysfunction and periventricular white-matter changes associated with Alzheimer's dementia.},

@article{Yemisci2009,
	Abstract = {Here we show that ischemia induces sustained contraction of pericytes on microvessels in the intact mouse brain. Pericytes remain contracted despite successful reopening of the middle cerebral artery after 2 h of ischemia. Pericyte contraction causes capillary constriction and obstructs erythrocyte flow. Suppression of oxidative-nitrative stress relieves pericyte contraction, reduces erythrocyte entrapment and restores microvascular patency; hence, tissue survival improves. In contrast, peroxynitrite application causes pericyte contraction. We also show that the microvessel wall is the major source of oxygen and nitrogen radicals causing ischemia and reperfusion-induced microvascular dysfunction. These findings point to a major but previously not recognized pathophysiological mechanism; ischemia and reperfusion-induced injury to pericytes may impair microcirculatory reflow and negatively affect survival by limiting substrate and drug delivery to tissue already under metabolic stress, despite recanalization of an occluded artery. Agents that can restore pericyte dysfunction and microvascular patency may increase the success of thrombolytic and neuroprotective treatments.},

@article{Kreisman1984,
	Abstract = {To resolve conflicting evidence of oxygen sufficiency or insufficiency during seizures, signals of metabolic and circulatory function were monitored in rat cerebral cortex during recurrent seizures. Early seizures were accompanied by increased blood volume, increased tPO2, and oxidative shifts of cytochrome a,a3, indicative of oxygen sufficiency. Later seizures were accompanied by a smaller increment in blood volume, a fall in tPO2, and shifts toward reduction of cytochrome a,a3, suggesting that cerebral oxygen supply became insufficient to meet demand. Responses suggesting oxygen insufficiency occurred during short duration ictal bursts, interictal spikes or electrocortical stimulation at times when longer duration ictal episodes still were accompanied by responses signalling oxygen sufficiency. These data indicate that there is a progressive dissociation of the normally tight couple between neuronal activity, energy demand, and cerebral blood flow during status epilepticus. Systemic derrangements that often accompanied recurrent seizures also contributed to decreased cerebral oxygenation. These factors may cause the neuronal damage reported to follow prolonged status epilepticus.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The functional modulation of blood flow in the brain is critical for brain health and is the basis of contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging. There is evident coupling between increases in neuronal activity and increases in local blood flow; however, many aspects of this neurovascular coupling remain unexplained by current models. Based on the rapid dilation of distant pial arteries during cortical functional hyperemia, we hypothesized that endothelial signaling may play a key role in the long-range propagation of vasodilation during functional hyperemia in the brain. Although well characterized in the peripheral vasculature, endothelial involvement in functional neurovascular coupling has not been demonstrated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We combined in vivo exposed-cortex multispectral optical intrinsic signal imaging (MS-OISI) with a novel in vivo implementation of the light-dye technique to record the cortical hemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulus in rats before and after spatially selective endothelial disruption. We demonstrate that discrete interruption of endothelial signaling halts propagation of stimulus-evoked vasodilation in pial arteries, and that wide-field endothelial disruption in pial arteries significantly attenuates the hemodynamic response to stimulus, particularly the early, rapid increase and peak in hyperemia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Involvement of endothelial pathways in functional neurovascular coupling provides new explanations for the spatial and temporal features of the hemodynamic response to stimulus and could explain previous results that were interpreted as evidence for astrocyte-mediated control of functional hyperemia. Our results unify many aspects of blood flow regulation in the brain and body and prompt new investigation of direct links between systemic cardiovascular disease and neural deficits.},

	Abstract = {Intercellular calcium (Ca(2+)) waves (ICWs) represent the propagation of increases in intracellular Ca(2+) through a syncytium of cells and appear to be a fundamental mechanism for coordinating multicellular responses. ICWs occur in a wide diversity of cells and have been extensively studied in vitro. More recent studies focus on ICWs in vivo. ICWs are triggered by a variety of stimuli and involve the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores. The propagation of ICWs predominately involves cell communication with internal messengers moving via gap junctions or extracellular messengers mediating paracrine signaling. ICWs appear to be important in both normal physiology as well as pathophysiological processes in a variety of organs and tissues including brain, liver, retina, cochlea, and vascular tissue. We review here the mechanisms of initiation and propagation of ICWs, the key intra- and extracellular messengers (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ATP) mediating ICWs, and the proposed physiological functions of ICWs.},

@article{Goldbeter1990,
	Abstract = {In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. {\&} Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. {\&} Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.},

	Abstract = {In spite of five decades of study, the biophysics of spreading depression (SD) is incompletely understood. Earlier we have modeled seizures and SD, and we have shown that currents through ion channels normally present in neuron membranes can generate SD-like depolarization. In the present study, we define the conditions for triggering SD and the parameters that influence its course in a model of a hippocampal pyramidal cell with more complete representation of ions and channels than the previous version. "Leak" conductances for Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) and an ion pump were present in the membrane of the entire cell; fast inactivating voltage dependent conductances for sodium and potassium in the soma; "persistent" conductances in soma and apical dendrite, and K(+)- and voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-controlled conductance in the apical dendrite. The neuron was surrounded by restricted interstitial space and by a "glia-endothelium" system of extracellular ion regulation bounded by a membrane having leak conductances and an ion pump. Ion fluxes and concentration changes were continuously computed as well as osmotic cell volume changes. As long as reuptake into the neuron and "buffering" by glia kept pace with K(+) released from the neuron, stimulating current applied to the soma evoked repetitive firing that stopped when stimulation ceased. When glial uptake was reduced, K(+) released from neurons could accumulate in the interstitium and keep the neuron depolarized so that strong depolarizing pulses injected into the soma were followed either by afterdischarge or SD. SD-like depolarization was ignited when depolarization spreading into the apical dendrite, activated persistent Na(+) current and NMDA-controlled current. With membrane parameters constant, varying the injected stimulating current influenced SD onset but neither the depolarization nor the increase in extracellular K(+). Glial "leak" conductance influenced SD duration and SD ignition point. Varying maximal conductances (representing channel density) also influenced SD onset time but not the amplitude of the depolarization. Hypoxia was simulated by turning off the Na-K exchange pump, and this resulted in SD-like depolarization. The results confirm that, once ignited, SD runs an all-or-none trajectory, the level of depolarization is governed by feedback involving ion shifts and glutamate acting on ion channels and not by the number of channels open, and SD is ignited if the net persistent membrane current in the apical dendrites turns inward.},

We report that transgenic mice overexpressing APP and Abeta have a profound attenuation in the increase in neocortical blood flow elicited by somatosensory activation. The impairment is highly correlated with brain Abeta concentration and is reproduced in normal mice by topical neocortical application of exogenous Abeta1-40 but not Abeta1-42. Overexpression of M146L mutant presenilin-1 in APP mice enhances the production of Abeta1-42 severalfold, but it does not produce a commensurate attenuation of the hyperemic response. APP and Abeta overexpression do not diminish the intensity of neural activation, as reflected by the increase in somatosensory cortex glucose usage. Thus, Abeta-induced alterations in functional hyperemia produce a potentially deleterious mismatch between substrate delivery and energy demands imposed by neural activity.},

	Abstract = {Brain hemodynamics serve as a proxy for neural activity in a range of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In resting-state fMRI, hemodynamic fluctuations have been found to exhibit patterns of bilateral synchrony, with correlated regions inferred to have functional connectivity. However, the relationship between resting-state hemodynamics and underlying neural activity has not been well established, making the neural underpinnings of functional connectivity networks unclear. In this study, neural activity and hemodynamics were recorded simultaneously over the bilateral cortex of awake and anesthetized Thy1-GCaMP mice using wide-field optical mapping. Neural activity was visualized via selective expression of the calcium-sensitive fluorophore GCaMP in layer 2/3 and 5 excitatory neurons. Characteristic patterns of resting-state hemodynamics were accompanied by more rapidly changing bilateral patterns of resting-state neural activity. Spatiotemporal hemodynamics could be modeled by convolving this neural activity with hemodynamic response functions derived through both deconvolution and gamma-variate fitting. Simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology confirmed that Thy1-GCaMP signals are well-predicted by multiunit activity. Neurovascular coupling between resting-state neural activity and hemodynamics was robust and fast in awake animals, whereas coupling in urethane-anesthetized animals was slower, and in some cases included lower-frequency ({\textless}0.04 Hz) hemodynamic fluctuations that were not well-predicted by local Thy1-GCaMP recordings. These results support that resting-state hemodynamics in the awake and anesthetized brain are coupled to underlying patterns of excitatory neural activity. The patterns of bilaterally-symmetric spontaneous neural activity revealed by wide-field Thy1-GCaMP imaging may depict the neural foundation of functional connectivity networks detected in resting-state fMRI.},

	Abstract = {Production of NO from arginine and molecular oxygen is a complex chemical reaction unique to biology. Our understanding of the chemical and regulation mechanisms of the NO synthases has developed over the past two decades, uncovering some extraordinary features. This article reviews recent progress and highlights current issues and controversies. The structure of the enzyme has now been determined almost in entirety, although it is as a selection of fragments, which are difficult to assemble unambiguously. NO synthesis is driven by electron transfer through FAD and FMN cofactors, which is controlled by calmodulin binding in the constitutive mammalian enzymes. Many of the unique structural features involved have been characterised, but the mechanics of calmodulin-dependent activation are largely unresolved. Ultimately, NO is produced in the active site by the reaction of arginine with activated heme-bound oxygen in two distinct cycles. The unique role of the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor as an electron donor in this process has now been established, but the subsequent chemical events are currently a matter of intense speculation and debate. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The signal used by both techniques is based on changes in local circulation and metabolism (brain work). Our understanding of the cell biology of these changes has progressed greatly in the past decade. New insights have emerged on the role of astrocytes in signal transduction as has an appreciation of the unique contribution of aerobic glycolysis to brain energy metabolism. Likewise our understanding of the neurophysiologic processes responsible for imaging signals has progressed from an assumption that spiking activity (output) of neurons is most relevant to one focused on their input. Finally, neuroimaging, with its unique metabolic perspective, has alerted us to the ongoing and costly intrinsic activity within brain systems that most likely represents the largest fraction of the brain's functional activity.},

@article{Sebastiao2001,
	Abstract = {Increased levels of glutamate and the subsequent activation of NMDA receptors are responsible for neuronal damage that occurs after an ischemic or hypoxic episode. In the present work, we investigated the relative contribution of presynaptic and postsynaptic blockade of synaptic transmission, as well as of blockade of NMDA receptors, for the facilitation of recovery of synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices exposed to prolonged (90 min) hypoxia. During hypoxia, there was a complete inhibition of field EPSPs, which was fully reversible if released adenosine was allowed to act. When adenosine A(1) receptors were blocked with the selective antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), recovery of synaptic transmission from hypoxia was significantly attenuated, and this impairment could be overcome by preventing synaptic transmission during hypoxia either with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or by switching off the afferent stimulation but not by postsynaptic blockade of transmission with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or selective blockade of adenosine A(2A) receptors. When synaptic transmission was allowed to occur during hypoxia, because of the presence of DPCPX, there was an NMDA receptor-mediated component of the EPSCs recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and blockade of NMDA receptors with AP-5 restored recovery of synaptic transmission from hypoxia. It is concluded that impairment of recovery of synaptic transmission after an hypoxic insult results from activation of synaptic NMDA receptors by synaptically released glutamate and that adenosine by preventing this activation efficiently facilitates recovery.},

@article{Bolz2003,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: NO-induced dilations in resistance arteries (RAs) are not associated with decreases in vascular smooth muscle cell Ca2+. We tested whether a cGMP-dependent activation of the smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) resulting in a Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile apparatus was the underlying mechanism and whether it could be antagonized by the RhoA pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+ sensitivity of RA was assessed as the relation between changes in diameter and [Ca2+]i in depolarized RA (120 mol/L K+) exposed to stepwise increases in Ca2+ex (0 to 3 mmol/L). Effects of 10 micromol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on Ca2+ sensitivity were determined before and after application of the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 micromol/L) and the MLCP inhibitor calyculin A (120 nmol/L) and in presence of the RhoA-activating phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, 12 nmol/L). SNP-induced dilations were also studied in controls and in RAs pretreated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 or transfected with a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19RhoA). Constrictions elicited by increasing Ca2+ex were significantly attenuated by SNP, which, however, left associated increases in [Ca2+]i unaffected. This NO-induced attenuation was blocked by ODQ, calyculin A, and S1P. The S1P-induced translocation of RhoA indicating activation of the GTPase was not reversed by SNP. Inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase by N19RhoA or Y27632 significantly augmented SNP-induced dilations.

CONCLUSIONS: NO dilates RA by activating the MLCP in a cGMP-dependent manner, thereby reducing the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. MLCP inactivation via the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway antagonizes this Ca2+-desensitizing effect that, in turn, can be restored using RhoA/Rho kinase inhibitors.},

@article{Emerson2001,
	Abstract = {Endothelial cells are considered electrically unexcitable. However, endothelium-dependent vasodilators (e.g., acetylcholine) often evoke hyperpolarization. We hypothesized that electrical stimulation of endothelial cells could evoke hyperpolarization and vasodilation. Feed artery segments (resting diameter: 63 +/- 1 microm; length 3-4 mm) of the hamster retractor muscle were isolated and pressurized to 75 mmHg, and focal stimulation was performed via microelectrodes positioned across one end of the vessel. Stimulation at 16 Hz (30-50 V, 1-ms pulses, 5 s) evoked constriction (-20 +/- 2 microm) that spread along the entire vessel via perivascular sympathetic nerves, as shown by inhibition with tetrodotoxin, omega-conotoxin, or phentolamine. In contrast, stimulation with direct current (30 V, 5 s) evoked vasodilation (16 +/- 2 microm) and hyperpolarization (11 +/- 1 mV) of endothelial and smooth muscle cells that conducted along the entire vessel. Conducted responses were insensitive to preceding treatments, atropine, or N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine, yet were abolished by endothelial cell damage (with air). Injection of negative current ({\textless}/=1.6 nA) into a single endothelial cell reproduced vasodilator responses along the entire vessel. We conclude that, independent of ligand-receptor interactions, endothelial cell hyperpolarization evokes vasodilation that is readily conducted along the vessel wall. Moreover, electrical events originating within a single endothelial cell can drive the relaxation of smooth muscle cells throughout the entire vessel.},

	Abstract = {Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14{\%} of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30{\%} of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extracellular concentration of potassium ion ([K+]o) may have a significant influence on the cerebral circulation in health and disease. Mechanisms of [K+]o-induced conducted vasomotor responses in cerebral arterioles, possibly linking microvascular regulation to neuronal activity, have not been examined. METHODS: We analyzed vascular responses to small increases of [K+]o (up to 5 mmol/L) in isolated, cannulated, and pressurized rat cerebral arterioles (36.5+/-1.4 micro m). [K+]o was elevated globally through extraluminal application or locally through micropipette, while arteriolar diameter was measured online. RESULTS: Elevation of [K+]o (5 mmol/L) produced dilation that was inhibited by ouabain but not BaCl2. Locally applied [K+]o (3 to 5 mmol/L) produced a biphasic response (initial constriction followed by dilation), both of which were conducted to the remote site (distance 1142+/-68 microm). Endothelial impairment inhibited conducted but not local biphasic responses. Extraluminal ouabain attenuated local and conducted secondary dilation but not initial constriction. The local biphasic response was unaffected by extraluminal or intraluminal BaCl2. Extraluminal but not intraluminal BaCl2 impaired both conducted constriction and dilation. CONCLUSIONS: In rat penetrating arteriole, (1) [K+]o (3 to 5 mmol/L) strongly regulates arteriolar tone and causes conducted vasomotor responses; (2) local responses to elevated [K+]o are endothelium independent but conducted responses are dependent on an intact endothelium; (3) smooth muscle Na+-K+-ATPase activation is the generator of conducted dilation; and (4) smooth muscle inward rectifier potassium channels sustain conduction. Our findings suggest that potassium-induced conducted vasomotor responses may link local neuronal activity to microvascular regulation, which may be attenuated in pathological conditions.},

	Abstract = {How focal seizures initiate and evolve in human neocortex remains a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Here, we use biophysical neuronal network models of neocortical patches to study how the interaction between inhibition and extracellular potassium ([K (+)] o ) dynamics may contribute to different types of focal seizures. Three main types of propagated focal seizures observed in recent intracortical microelectrode recordings in humans were modelled: seizures characterized by sustained (∼30-60 Hz) gamma local field potential (LFP) oscillations; seizures where the onset in the propagated site consisted of LFP spikes that later evolved into rhythmic (∼2-3 Hz) spike-wave complexes (SWCs); and seizures where a brief stage of low-amplitude fast-oscillation (∼10-20 Hz) LFPs preceded the SWC activity. Our findings are fourfold: (1) The interaction between elevated [K (+)] o (due to abnormal potassium buffering by glial cells) and the strength of synaptic inhibition plays a predominant role in shaping these three types of seizures. (2) Strengthening of inhibition leads to the onset of sustained narrowband gamma seizures. (3) Transition into SWC seizures is obtained either by the weakening of inhibitory synapses, or by a transient strengthening followed by an inhibitory breakdown (e.g. GABA depletion). This reduction or breakdown of inhibition among fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons increases their spiking activity and leads them eventually into depolarization block. Ictal spike-wave discharges in the model are then sustained solely by pyramidal neurons. (4) FS cell dynamics are also critical for seizures where the evolution into SWC activity is preceded by low-amplitude fast oscillations. Different levels of elevated [K (+)] o were important for transitions into and maintenance of sustained gamma oscillations and SWC discharges. Overall, our modelling study predicts that the interaction between inhibitory interneurons and [K (+)] o glial buffering under abnormal conditions may explain different types of ictal transitions and dynamics during propagated seizures in human focal epilepsy.},

	Abstract = {Nearly 400 years ago, Thomas Willis described the arterial ring at the base of the brain (the circle of Willis, CW) and recognized it as a compensatory system in the case of arterial occlusion. This theory is still accepted. We present several arguments that via negativa should discard the compensatory theory. (1) Current theory is anthropocentric; it ignores other species and their analog structures. (2) Arterial pathologies are diseases of old age, appearing after gene propagation. (3) According to the current theory, evolution has foresight. (4) Its commonness among animals indicates that it is probably a convergent evolutionary structure. (5) It was observed that communicating arteries are too small for effective blood flow, and (6) missing or hypoplastic in the majority of the population. We infer that CW, under physiologic conditions, serves as a passive pressure dissipating system; without considerable blood flow, pressure is transferred from the high to low pressure end, the latter being another arterial component of CW. Pressure gradient exists because pulse wave and blood flow arrive into the skull through different cerebral arteries asynchronously, due to arterial tree asymmetry. Therefore, CW and its communicating arteries protect cerebral artery and blood-brain barrier from hemodynamic stress.},

	Abstract = {In spite of intense recent investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenously produced nitric oxide (.NO) in mammalian systems, little quantitative information exists concerning the diffusion of this small nonelectrolyte from its source (NO synthase) to its targets of action. I present here a conceptual framework for analyzing the intracellular and intercellular diffusion and reaction of free .NO, using kinetic modeling and calculations of the diffusibility of .NO and its reactions in aqueous solution based on published data. If the half-life of .NO is greater than approximately 25 msec and the rates of reaction of .NO with its targets are slower than its diffusion or reaction with O2 (for which there is experimental evidence in at least some systems), then (i) .NO acts in vivo in a mostly paracrine fashion for a collection of .NO-producing cells, (ii) .NO diffuses to significant concentrations at distances relatively far removed from a single .NO-producing cell, and (iii) localized sites of vascularization will scavenge .NO (and thus decrease its actions) at distances many cell diameters away from that site. These conclusions have important implications with regard to the mechanism of endothelium-dependent relaxation, the autocrine vs. paracrine actions of .NO, and the role of the spatial relationship between specific sites of .NO formation and neighboring blood vessels in .NO-effected and -affected neuronal signal transmission.},

	Abstract = {Normal brain function depends critically on moment-to-moment regulation of oxygen supply by the bloodstream to meet changing metabolic needs. Neurovascular coupling, a range of mechanisms that converge on arterioles to adjust local cerebral blood flow (CBF), represents our current framework for understanding this regulation. We modeled the combined effects of CBF and capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTTH) on the maximum oxygen extraction fraction (OEF(max)) and metabolic rate of oxygen that can biophysically be supported, for a given tissue oxygen tension. Red blood cell velocity recordings in rat brain support close hemodynamic-metabolic coupling by means of CBF and CTTH across a range of physiological conditions. The CTTH reduction improves tissue oxygenation by counteracting inherent reductions in OEF(max) as CBF increases, and seemingly secures sufficient oxygenation during episodes of hyperemia resulting from cortical activation or hypoxemia. In hypoperfusion and states of blocked CBF, both lower oxygen tension and CTTH may secure tissue oxygenation. Our model predicts that disturbed capillary flows may cause a condition of malignant CTTH, in which states of higher CBF display lower oxygen availability. We propose that conditions with altered capillary morphology, such as amyloid, diabetic or hypertensive microangiopathy, and ischemia-reperfusion, may disturb CTTH and thereby flow-metabolism coupling and cerebral oxygen metabolism.},

	Abstract = {The precise regulation of cerebral blood flow is critical for normal brain function, and its disruption underlies many neuropathologies. The extent to which smooth muscle-covered arterioles or pericytecovered capillaries control vasomotion during neurovascular coupling remains controversial. We found that capillary pericytes in mice and humans do not express smooth muscle actin and are morphologically and functionally distinct from adjacent precapillary smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Using optical imaging we investigated blood flow regulation at various sites on the vascular tree in living mice. Optogenetic, whisker stimulation, or cortical spreading depolarization caused microvascular diameter or flow changes in SMC but not pericyte-covered microvessels. During early stages of brain ischemia, transient SMC but not pericyte constrictions were a major cause of hypoperfusion leading to thrombosis and distal microvascular occlusions. Thus, capillary pericytes are not contractile, and regulation of cerebral blood flow in physiological and pathological conditions is mediated by arteriolar SMCs.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vasodilator with various activities in the cerebral vasculature. Although the response of NO levels to shear stress has been investigated in various models using systemic endothelium, no study has evaluated human cerebral endothelial cells (HCE). We determined the NO levels of HCE cultured in an artificial capillary system in response to changes in shear stress. With direct measurement by a porphyrinic microsensor, we found that NO levels increased immediately with a peak at 7 h after changes in shear stress, and by 24 h dropped to a constant elevated baseline. Shear stress-mediated increases in NO levels were confirmed by the measurement of citrulline, an indirect measure of NO. Furthermore, NO levels by HCE were shown to decrease with decreasing shear stress levels. This study presents a novel system to study NO production by microvascular HCE, and indicates a linear relationship between shear stress and NO levels. As cerebral vessels age and lose transmural compliance, shear stress-mediated production of NO may play a greater role in cerebrovascular function and dysfunction.},

@article{Santucci2008b,
	Abstract = {N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors are widely expressed in the brain and are critical for many forms of synaptic plasticity. Subtypes of the NMDA receptor NR2 subunit are differentially expressed during development; in the forebrain, the NR2B receptor is dominant early in development, and later both NR2A and NR2B are expressed. In heterologous expression systems, NR2A-containing receptors open more reliably and show much faster opening and closing kinetics than do NR2B-containing receptors. However, conflicting data, showing similar open probabilities, exist for receptors expressed in neurons. Similarly, studies of synaptic plasticity have produced divergent results, with some showing that only NR2A-containing receptors can drive long-term potentiation and others showing that either subtype is capable of driving potentiation. In order to address these conflicting results as well as open questions about the number and location of functional receptors in the synapse, we constructed a Monte Carlo model of glutamate release, diffusion, and binding to NMDA receptors and of receptor opening and closing as well as a model of the activation of calcium-calmodulin kinase II, an enzyme critical for induction of synaptic plasticity, by NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx. Our results suggest that the conflicting data concerning receptor open probabilities can be resolved, with NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors having very different opening probabilities. They also support the conclusion that receptors containing either subtype can drive long-term potentiation. We also are able to estimate the number of functional receptors at a synapse from experimental data. Finally, in our models, the opening of NR2B-containing receptors is highly dependent on the location of the receptor relative to the site of glutamate release whereas the opening of NR2A-containing receptors is not. These results help to clarify the previous findings and suggest future experiments to address open questions concerning NMDA receptor function.},

In Escherichia coli, the arginine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways are connected through a common metabolite provided by a single enzyme. The different elements of the arginine biosynthetic system of Escherichia coli, including the connection with pyrimidine biosynthesis, and the principal regulatory mechanisms operating at genetic and enzymatic levels were integrated in a mathematical model using a molecular kinetic approach combined with a modular description of the system. The model was then used to simulate a set of perturbed conditions as follows: genetic derepression, feedback resistance of the first enzymatic step, and low constitutive synthesis of the intermediate carbamyl phosphate. In all cases, an excellent quantitative agreement between simulations and experimental results was found. The model was used to gain further insight into the function of the system, including the synergy between the different regulations. The outcome of combinations of perturbations on cellular arginine concentration was predicted accurately, establishing the model as a powerful tool for the design of arginine-overproducing strains.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes in midlife or late life increases the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), and type 1 diabetes has been associated with a higher risk of detrimental cognitive outcomes, although studies from older adults are lacking. We investigated whether individuals with AD were more likely to have a history of diabetes than matched controls from the general aged population.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on reimbursed diabetes medication (including both type 1 and 2 diabetes) of all Finnish individuals with reimbursed AD medication in 2005 (n = 28,093) and their AD-free control subjects during 1972-2005 was obtained from a special reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institute of Finland.

RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 11.4{\%} in the whole study population, 10.7{\%} (n = 3,012) among control subjects, and 12.0{\%} (n = 3,372) among AD case subjects. People with AD were more likely to have diabetes than matched control subjects (unadjusted OR 1.14 [95{\%} CI 1.08-1.20]), even after adjusting for cardiovascular diseases (OR 1.31 [1.22-1.41]). The associations were stronger with diabetes diagnosed at midlife (adjusted OR 1.60 [1.34-1.84] and 1.25 [1.16-1.36] for midlife and late-life diabetes, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with clinically verified AD are more likely to have a history of clinically verified and medically treated diabetes than the general aged population, although the difference is small.},

Difficulties in imaging the complex microanatomy of the cortex have so far restricted insight about blood flow distribution in the microcirculation. A new methodology combining advanced microscopy data with large scale hemodynamic simulations enabled us to quantify the effect of the angioarchitecture on the cerebral microcirculation. High-resolution images of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex were input into with a comprehensive computational model of cerebral perfusion and oxygen supply ranging from the pial vessels to individual brain cells. Simulations of blood flow, hematocrit and oxygen tension show that the wide variation of hemodynamic states in the tortuous, randomly organized capillary bed is responsible for relatively uniform cortical tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Computational analysis of microcirculatory blood flow and pressure drops further indicates that the capillary bed, including capillaries adjacent to feeding arterioles (d {\textless}10 µm), are the largest contributors to hydraulic resistance.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides a brief overview of how we got involved in fMRI work and of our efforts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BOLD signal changes. The phenomenon discussed here in particular is the post-stimulus undershoot (PSU), the interpretation of which has captivated many fMRI scientists and is still under debate to date. This controversy is caused both by the convoluted physiological origin of the BOLD effect, which allows many possible explanations, and the lack of comprehensive data in the early years. BOLD effects reflect changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), volume (CBV), metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and hematocrit fraction (Hct). However, the size of such effects is modulated by vascular origin such as intravascular, extravascular, macro and microvascular, venular and capillary, the relative contributions of which depend not only on the spatial resolution of the measurements, but also on stimulus duration, on magnetic field strength and on whether spin echo (SE) or gradient echo (GRE) detection is used. The two most dominant explanations of the PSU have been delayed vascular compliance (first venular, later arteriolar, and recently capillary) and sustained increases in CMRO2, while post-activation reduction in CBF is a distant third. MRI has the capability to independently measure CBF and arteriolar, venous, and total CBV contributions in humans and animals, which has been of great assistance in improving the understanding of BOLD phenomena. Using currently available MRI and optical data, we conclude that the predominant PSU origin is a sustained increase in CMRO2. However, some contributions from delayed vascular compliance are likely, and small CBF undershoot contributions that are difficult to detect with current arterial spin labeling technology can also not be excluded. The relative contribution of these different processes, which are not mutually exclusive and can act together, is likely to vary with stimulus duration and type. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {The coupling of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity is well preserved during evolution. Upon changes in the neuronal activity, an incompletely understood coupling mechanism regulates diameter changes of supplying blood vessels, which adjust CBF within seconds. The physiologic brain tissue oxygen content would sustain unimpeded brain function for only 1 second if continuous oxygen supply would suddenly stop. This suggests that the CBF response has evolved to balance oxygen supply and demand. Surprisingly, CBF increases surpass the accompanying increases of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). However, a disproportionate CBF increase may be required to increase the concentration gradient from capillary to tissue that drives oxygen delivery. However, the brain tissue oxygen content is not zero, and tissue pO2 decreases could serve to increase oxygen delivery without a CBF increase. Experimental evidence suggests that CMRO2 can increase with constant CBF within limits and decreases of baseline CBF were observed with constant CMRO2. This conflicting evidence may be viewed as an oxygen paradox of neurovascular coupling. As a possible solution for this paradox, we hypothesize that the CBF response has evolved to safeguard brain function in situations of moderate pathophysiological interference with oxygen supply.},

	Abstract = {The factors responsible for the unusual susceptibility of the hippocampus to seizures and ischemic cell damage are not well understood. The CA1 pyramidal subfield of the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to seizure activity and damage after ischemia. The possibility was examined that regional differences exist in extracellular volume, which might influence neuronal excitability and response to injury in the hippocampus. CA1 stratum pyramidale exhibited an exceptionally low extracellular volume fraction (EVF) of 0.12, whereas the EVFs of CA3 and dentate were considerably higher--0.18 and 0.15, respectively. The EVF of CA1 stratum pyramidale was reversibly reduced by 30 percent when the extracellular potassium concentration was raised from 3.5 to 8.5 mM, a procedure that induced spontaneous electrographic seizures in CA1. Thus there are regional variations in the properties of the extracellular space in the hippocampus that might underlie the propensity of the CA1 region to develop seizures and to suffer damage after ischemia.},

	Abstract = {Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by changes in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). In response to stimulation, Ca(2+) increase in a single cell can propagate to neighbouring cells through gap junctions, as intercellular Ca(2+) waves. To investigate the mechanisms underlying Ca(2+) wave propagation between smooth muscle cells, we used primary cultured rat mesenteric smooth muscle cells (pSMCs). Cells were aligned with the microcontact printing technique and a single pSMC was locally stimulated by mechanical stimulation or by microejection of KCl. Mechanical stimulation evoked two distinct Ca(2+) waves: (1) a fast wave (2mm/s) that propagated to all neighbouring cells, and (2) a slow wave (20{\$}\mu{\$}m/s) that was spatially limited in propagation. KCl induced only fast Ca(2+) waves of the same velocity as the mechanically induced fast waves. Inhibition of gap junctions, voltage-operated calcium channels, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and ryanodine receptors, shows that the fast wave was due to gap junction mediated membrane depolarization and subsequent Ca(2+) influx through voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels, whereas, the slow wave was due to Ca(2+) release primarily through IP(3) receptors. Altogether, these results indicate that temporally and spatially distinct mechanisms allow intercellular communication between SMCs. In intact arteries this may allow fine tuning of vessel tone.},

Functional studies have uncovered several types of Ca2+ channel, distinguished by pharmacology, electrophysiology and tissue localization. More recently, molecular cloning has revealed an even greater diversity among Ca2+ channels, arising from multiple genes and alternative splicing. L-type, dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels have been the most extensively characterized to date. Recently, Numa's group has reported the cloning and expression of a dihydropyridine-insensitive Ca2+ channel from brain that most closely resembles the P-tupe channel described by Llinas and colleagues.

@article{Reneman2008,
	Abstract = {Based upon theory, wall shear stress (WSS), an important determinant of endothelial function and gene expression, has been assumed to be constant along the arterial tree and the same in a particular artery across species. In vivo measurements of WSS, however, have shown that these assumptions are far from valid. In this survey we will discuss the assessment of WSS in the arterial system in vivo and present the results obtained in large arteries and arterioles. In vivo WSS can be estimated from wall shear rate, as derived from non-invasively recorded velocity profiles, and whole blood viscosity in large arteries and plasma viscosity in arterioles, avoiding theoretical assumptions. In large arteries velocity profiles can be recorded by means of a specially designed ultrasound system and in arterioles via optical techniques using fluorescent flow velocity tracers. It is shown that in humans mean WSS is substantially higher in the carotid artery (1.1-1.3 Pa) than in the brachial (0.4-0.5 Pa) and femoral (0.3-0.5 Pa) arteries. Also in animals mean WSS varies substantially along the arterial tree. Mean WSS in arterioles varies between about 1.0 and 5.0 Pa in the various studies and is dependent on the site of measurement in these vessels. Across species mean WSS in a particular artery decreases linearly with body mass, e.g., in the infra-renal aorta from 8.8 Pa in mice to 0.5 Pa in humans. The observation that mean WSS is far from constant along the arterial tree implies that Murray's cube law on flow-diameter relations cannot be applied to the whole arterial system. Because blood flow velocity is not constant along the arterial tree either, a square law also does not hold. The exponent in the power law likely varies along the arterial system, probably from 2 in large arteries near the heart to 3 in arterioles. The in vivo findings also imply that in in vitro studies no average shear stress value can be taken to study effects on endothelial cells derived from different vascular areas or from the same artery in different species. The cells have to be studied under the shear stress conditions they are exposed to in real life.},

	Abstract = {Here we attempted to test a novel hypothesis that hypoxia may induce Ca(2+) release through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated dissociation of FK506-binding protein 12.6 (FKBP12.6) from ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). The results reveal that hypoxic exposure significantly decreased the amount of FKBP12.6 on the SR of PAs and increased FKBP12.6 in the cytosol. The colocalization of FKBP12.6 with RyRs was decreased in intact PASMCs. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of intracellular ROS generation prevented hypoxia from decreasing FKBP12.6 on the SR and increasing FKBP12.6 in the cytosol. Exogenous ROS (H(2)O(2)) reduced FKBP12.6 on the SR and augmented FKBP12.6 in the cytosol. Oxidized FKBP12.6 was absent on the SR from PAs pretreated with and without hypoxia, but it was present with a higher amount in the cytosol from PAs pretreated with than without hypoxia. Hypoxia and H(2)O(2) diminished the association of FKBP12.6 from type 2 RyRs (RyR2). The activity of RyRs was increased in PAs pretreated with hypoxia or H(2)O(2). FKBP12.6 removal enhanced, whereas RyR2 gene deletion blocked the hypoxic increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in PASMCs. Collectively, we conclude that hypoxia may induce Ca(2+) release by causing ROS-mediated dissociation of FKBP12.6 from RyR2 in PASMCs.},

	Abstract = {When developing large-scale mathematical models of physiology, some reduction in complexity is necessarily required to maintain computational efficiency. A prime example of such an intricate cell is the cardiac myocyte. For the predictive power of the cardiomyocyte models, it is vital to accurately describe the calcium transport mechanisms, since they essentially link the electrical activation to contractility. The removal of calcium from the cytoplasm takes place mainly by the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). In the present study, we review the properties of SERCA, its frequency-dependent and beta-adrenergic regulation, and the approaches of mathematical modelling that have been used to investigate its function. Furthermore, we present novel theoretical considerations that might prove useful for the elucidation of the role of SERCA in cardiac function, achieving a reduction in model complexity, but at the same time retaining the central aspects of its function. Our results indicate that to faithfully predict the physiological properties of SERCA, we should take into account the calcium-buffering effect and reversible function of the pump. This 'uncomplicated' modelling approach could be useful to other similar transport mechanisms as well.},

	Abstract = {A major breakthrough in neuroscience has been the realization in the last decades that the dogmatic view of astroglial cells as being merely fostering and buffering elements of the nervous system is simplistic. A wealth of investigations now shows that astrocytes actually participate in the control of synaptic transmission in an active manner. This was first hinted by the intimate contacts glial processes make with neurons, particularly at the synaptic level, and evidenced using electrophysiological and calcium imaging techniques. Calcium imaging has provided critical evidence demonstrating that astrocytic regulation of synaptic efficacy is not a passive phenomenon. However, given that cellular activation is not only represented by calcium signaling, it is also crucial to assess concomitant mechanisms. We and others have used electrophysiological techniques to simultaneously record neuronal and astrocytic activity, thus enabling the study of multiple ionic currents and in depth investigation of neuro-glial dialogues. In the current review, we focus on the input such approach has provided in the understanding of astrocyte-neuron interactions underlying control of synaptic efficacy.},

LCGU was measured by the [14C]deoxyglucose technique and LCBF by the [14C]iodoantipyrine technique. When the LCGU of 39 brain structures was correlated with their respective values of LCBF an excellent correlation (r = 0.96) was obtained between LCGU and LCBF, demonstrating a tight coupling at a local level. Chronic metabolic acidosis was induced in two other groups of rats by adding 0.35 M NH4Cl to the drinking water for 5-6 days. This resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in overall cerebral glucose utilization (-29{\%}) and a nonsignificant reduction in overall cerebral blood flow (-8{\%}). This dissociation between the overall cerebral glucose utilization and blood flow during metabolic acidosis cannot be taken as an indicator of uncoupling because the values for LCGU were still well correlated (r = 0.95) with the values for LCBF, indicating a resetting of the coupling mechanism to a new level.},

	Abstract = {Three types of vascular dysfunction have been described in multiple sclerosis (MS). First, findings from epidemiological studies suggest that patients with MS have a higher risk for ischaemic stroke than people who do not have MS. The underlying mechanism is unknown, but might involve endothelial dysfunction secondary to inflammatory disease activity and increased plasma homocysteine concentrations. Second, patients with MS have global cerebral hypoperfusion, which might predispose them to the development of ischaemic stroke. The widespread decrease in perfusion in normal-appearing white matter and grey matter in MS seems not to be secondary to axonal degeneration, but might be a result of reduced axonal activity, reduced astrocyte energy metabolism, and perhaps increased blood concentrations of endothelin-1. Data suggest that a subtype of focal MS lesions might have an ischaemic origin, and there seems to be a link between reduced white matter perfusion and cognitive dysfunction in MS. Third, the pathology of MS might be the consequence of a chronic state of impaired venous drainage from the CNS, for which the term chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) has been coined. A number of recent vascular studies do not support the CCSVI theory, but some elements of CCSVI might be explained by slower cerebral venous blood flow secondary to the reduced cerebral perfusion in patients with MS compared with healthy individuals. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an Andronov--Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it can fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing. We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend ...},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), the smallest signalling molecule known, is produced by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). They all utilize l-arginine and molecular oxygen as substrates and require the cofactors reduced nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). All NOS bind calmodulin and contain haem. Neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS I) is constitutively expressed in central and peripheral neurons and some other cell types. Its functions include synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS), central regulation of blood pressure, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilatation via peripheral nitrergic nerves. Nitrergic nerves are of particular importance in the relaxation of corpus cavernosum and penile erection. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil) require at least a residual nNOS activity for their action. Inducible NOS (NOS II) can be expressed in many cell types in response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, or other agents. Inducible NOS generates large amounts of NO that have cytostatic effects on parasitic target cells. Inducible NOS contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and septic shock. Endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS III) is mostly expressed in endothelial cells. It keeps blood vessels dilated, controls blood pressure, and has numerous other vasoprotective and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Many cardiovascular risk factors lead to oxidative stress, eNOS uncoupling, and endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature. Pharmacologically, vascular oxidative stress can be reduced and eNOS functionality restored with renin- and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, with angiotensin receptor blockers, and with statins.},

	Abstract = {The locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of brain noradrenalin (NA), modulates cortical activity, cerebral blood flow (CBF), glucose metabolism, and blood-brain barrier permeability. However, the role of the LC-NA system in the regulation of cortical CBF has remained elusive. This rat study shows that similar proportions (∼20{\%}) of cortical pyramidal cells and GABA interneurons are contacted by LC-NA afferents on their cell soma or proximal dendrites. LC stimulation induced ipsilateral activation (c-Fos upregulation) of pyramidal cells and of a larger proportion ({\textgreater}36{\%}) of interneurons that colocalize parvalbumin, somatostatin, or nitric oxide synthase compared with pyramidal cells expressing cyclooxygenase-2 (22{\%}, p {\textless}0.05) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-containing interneurons (16{\%}, p {\textless}0.01). Concurrently, LC stimulation elicited larger ipsilateral compared with contralateral increases in cortical CBF (52 vs 31{\%}, p {\textless}0.01). These CBF responses were almost abolished (-70{\%}, p {\textless}0.001) by cortical NA denervation with DSP-4 [N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride] and were significantly reduced by {\$}\alpha{\$}- and {\$}\beta{\$}-adrenoceptor antagonists (-40{\%}, p {\textless}0.001 and -30{\%}, p {\textless}0.05, respectively). Blockade of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission with NMDA or GABA(A) receptor antagonists potently reduced the LC-induced hyperemic response (-56{\%}, p {\textless}0.001 or -47{\%}, p {\textless}0.05). Moreover, inhibition of astroglial metabolism (-35{\%}, p {\textless}0.01), vasoactive epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs; -60{\%}, p {\textless}0.001) synthesis, large-conductance, calcium-operated (BK, -52{\%}, p {\textless}0.05), and inward-rectifier (Kir, -40{\%}, p {\textless}0.05) K+ channels primarily impaired the hyperemic response. The data demonstrate that LC stimulation recruits a broad network of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons resulting in increased cortical activity and that K+ fluxes and EET signaling mediate a large part of the hemodynamic response.},

	Abstract = {Many cells express ryanodine receptors (RyRs) whose activation is thought to amplify depolarization-evoked elevations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+](i) through a process of Ca2+ -induced Ca2+ release (CICR). In neurons, it is usually assumed that CICR triggers net Ca2+ release from an ER Ca2+ store. However, since net ER Ca 2+ transport depends on the relative rates of Ca2+ uptake and release via distinct pathways, weak activation of a CICR pathway during periods of ER Ca accumulation would have a totally different effect: attenuation of Ca2+ accumulation. Stronger CICR activation at higher [Ca2+](i) could further attenuate Ca2+ accumulation or trigger net Ca2+ release, depending on the quantitative properties of the underlying Ca2+ transporters. This and the companion study (Hongpaisan, J., N.B. Pivovarova, S.L. Colgrove, R.D. Leapman, and D.D. Friel, and S.B. Andrews. 2001. J. Gen. Physiol. 118:101-112) investigate which of these CICR "modes" operate during depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry in sympathetic neurons. The present study focuses on small [Ca2+](i) elevations (less than approximately 350 nM) evoked by weak depolarization. The following two approaches were used: (1) Ca2+ fluxes were estimated from simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+](i) and I(Ca) in fura-2-loaded cells (perforated patch conditions), and (2) total ER Ca concentrations ([Ca](ER)) were measured using X-ray microanalysis. Flux analysis revealed triggered net Ca2+ release during depolarization in the presence but not the absence of caffeine, and [Ca2+](i) responses were accelerated by SERCA inhibitors, implicating ER Ca2+ accumulation, which was confirmed by direct [Ca](ER) measurements. Ryanodine abolished caffeine-induced CICR and enhanced depolarization-induced ER Ca2+ accumulation, indicating that activation of the CICR pathway normally attenuates ER Ca2+ accumulation, which is a novel mechanism for accelerating evoked [Ca2+](i) responses. Theory shows how such a low gain mode of CICR can operate during weak stimulation and switch to net Ca2+ release at high [Ca2+](i), a transition demonstrated in the companion study. These results emphasize the importance of the relative rates of Ca2+ uptake and release in defining ER contributions to depolarization-induced Ca2+ signals.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) exists in three established isoforms. NOS I (NOS1, ncNOS) was originally discovered in neurons. This enzyme and splice variants thereof have since been found in many other cells and tissues. NOS II (NOS2, iNOS) was first identified in murine macrophages, but can also be induced in many other cell types. NOS III (NOS3, ecNOS) is expressed mainly in endothelial cells. Whereas NOS II is a transcriptionally regulated enzyme, NOS I and NOS III are considered constitutively expressed proteins. However, evidence generated in recent years indicates that these two isoforms are also subject to expressional regulation. In view of the important biological functions of these isoforms, changes in their expression may have physiological and pathophysiological consequences. This review recapitulates compounds and conditions that modulate the expression of NOS I and NOS III, summarizes transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects that underlie these changes, and-where known-describes the molecular mechanisms leading to changes in transcription, RNA stability, or translation of these enzymes.},

Certain conditions such as a build-up of atherosclerotic plaque on the arterial wall can result in ischaemic damage and stroke-like symptoms. A three-dimensional computer model has been developed based on the results of magnetic resonance imaging data, incorporating a numerical algorithm to simulate the body's autoregulation mechanism, such that oxygen delivery to the cerebral territories can be predicted in response events, leading to a reduction in cerebral blood flow.

	Abstract = {Substantial evidence from epidemiological, pathological, and clinical reports suggests that vascular factors are critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and changes in blood flow are currently the most reliable indicators of the disease. We previously reported that older APP23 transgenic (tg) mice have significant blood flow alterations correlated with structural modifications of blood vessels. For the present study, our objective was to analyze the age-dependent morphological and architectural changes of the cerebral vasculature of APP23 tg mice. To visualize the 3D arrangement of the entire brain vasculature, we used vascular corrosion casts. Already at young ages, when typically parenchymal amyloid plaques are not yet present, APP23 tg mice had significant alterations, particularly of the microvasculature, often accompanied by small deposits attached to the vessels. In older animals, vasculature abruptly ended at amyloid plaques, resulting in holes. Often, small deposits were sitting near or at the end of truncated vessels. Between such holes, the surrounding vascular array appeared more dense and showed features typical for angiogenesis. We propose that small amyloid aggregates associated with the microvasculature lead to morphological and architectural alterations of the vasculature, resulting in altered local blood flow. The characteristic early onset of vascular alterations suggests that imaging blood flow and/or vasculature architecture could be used as a tool for early diagnosis of the disease and to monitor therapies.},

	Abstract = {System x(c)(-) represents an intriguing target in attempts to understand the pathological states of the central nervous system. Also called a cystine-glutamate antiporter, system x(c)(-) typically functions by exchanging one molecule of extracellular cystine for one molecule of intracellular glutamate. Nonvesicular glutamate released during cystine-glutamate exchange activates extrasynaptic glutamate receptors in a manner that shapes synaptic activity and plasticity. These findings contribute to the intriguing possibility that extracellular glutamate is regulated by a complex network of release and reuptake mechanisms, many of which are unique to glutamate and rarely depicted in models of excitatory signaling. Because system x(c)(-) is often expressed on non-neuronal cells, the study of cystine-glutamate exchange may advance the emerging viewpoint that glia are active contributors to information processing in the brain. It is noteworthy that system x(c)(-) is at the interface between excitatory signaling and oxidative stress, because the uptake of cystine that results from cystine-glutamate exchange is critical in maintaining the levels of glutathione, a critical antioxidant. As a result of these dual functions, system x(c)(-) has been implicated in a wide array of central nervous system diseases ranging from addiction to neurodegenerative disorders to schizophrenia. In the current review, we briefly discuss the major cellular components that regulate glutamate homeostasis, including glutamate release by system x(c)(-). This is followed by an in-depth discussion of system x(c)(-) as it relates to glutamate release, cystine transport, and glutathione synthesis. Finally, the role of system x(c)(-) is surveyed across a number of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.},

Ca2+ signalling is central to the endothelium's mechanotransduction and networked activity. However, challenges in imaging Ca2+ in large numbers of endothelial cells under conditions that preserve the intact physical configuration of pressurized arteries have limited progress in understanding how pressure-dependent mechanical forces alter networkedCa2+ signalling.We developed aminiature wide-field, gradient-index (GRIN) optical probe designed to fit inside an intact pressurized artery that permitted Ca2+ signalstobeimaged with subcellularresolutioninalargenumber(?200) of naturally connected endothelial cells at various pressures. Chemical (acetylcholine) activation triggered spatiotemporally complex, propagating inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca2+ waves that originated in clusters of cells and progressed from there across the endothelium. Mechanical stimulation of the artery, by increased intraluminal pressure, flattened the end- othelial cells and suppressed IP3-mediated Ca2+ signals in all activated cells. By computationally modelling Ca2+ release, endothelial shape changes were shown to alter the geometry of the Ca2+ diffusive environment near IP3 receptor microdomains to limit IP3-mediated Ca2+ signals as pressure increased. Changes in cell shape produce a geometric microdomain regulation of IP3-mediated Ca2+ signalling to explainmacroscopic pressure-dependent, endothelial mechano- sensing without the need for a conventionalmechanoreceptor. The suppression of IP3-mediated Ca2+ signalling may explain the decrease in endothelial activity as pressure increases. GRIN imaging provides a convenient method that gives access to hundreds of endothelial cells in intact arteries in physiological configuration. C.Wilson},

In vivo studies, encompassing the real-time measurement of (*)NO concentration dynamics have allowed us to gain quantitative insights into the mechanisms inherent to (*)NO-mediated signaling pathways. It has been of particular interest to study the diffusion properties and half-life, the interplay between (*)NO and O(2) and the ensuing functional consequences for regulation of O(2) consumption, the role of vasculature in shaping (*)NO signals in vivo, and the mechanisms that are responsible for (*)NO to achieve the coupling between glutamatergic neuronal activation and local microcirculation.},

	Abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by brain endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvasculature, and is an important mechanism for protecting the brain from fluctuations in plasma composition, and from circulating agents such as neurotransmitters and xenobiotics capable of disturbing neural function. The barrier also plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment necessary for the stable and co-ordinated activity of neurones. The BBB phenotype develops under the influence of associated brain cells, especially astrocytic glia, and consists of more complex tight junctions than in other capillary endothelia, and a number of specific transport and enzyme systems which regulate molecular traffic across the endothelial cells. Transporters characteristic of the BBB phenotype include both uptake mechanisms (e.g. GLUT-1 glucose carrier, L1 amino acid transporter) and efflux transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein). In addition to a role in long-term barrier induction and maintenance, astrocytes and other cells can release chemical factors that modulate endothelial permeability over a time-scale of seconds to minutes. Cell culture models, both primary and cell lines, have been used to investigate aspects of barrier induction and modulation. Conditioned medium taken from growing glial cells can reproduce some of the inductive effects, evidence for involvement of diffusible factors. However, for some features of endothelial differentiation and induction, the extracellular matrix plays an important role. Several candidate molecules have been identified, capable of mimicking aspects of glial-mediated barrier induction of brain endothelium; these include TGFbeta, GDNF, bFGF, IL-6 and steroids. In addition, factors secreted by brain endothelial cells including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been shown to induce astrocytic differentiation. Thus endothelium and astrocytes are involved in two-way induction. Short-term modulation of brain endothelial permeability has been shown for a number of small chemical mediators produced by astrocytes and other nearby cell types. It is clear that endothelial cells are involved in both long- and short-term chemical communication with neighbouring cells, with the perivascular end feet of astrocytes being of particular importance. The role of barrier induction and modulation in normal physiology and in pathology is discussed.},

	Abstract = {TRPM2 and TPPV4 channels, two members of TRP channel family, are known to be widely expressed in the brain but their exact expression pattern and function are not well understood. Due to their high Ca2+ permeability and gating by reactive oxygen species (TRPM2), or cell swelling, low pH and high temperature (TRPV4), they are likely to be involved in cell damage associated with various brain pathologies. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of these channels and their potential role in oxidative stress-induced cell damage in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, a model that retains the complex interaction between neurons and astrocytes. Channel expression was confirmed with RT-PCR and western blotting, while immunocytochemistry demonstrated TRPM2 in CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurons and TRPV4 in astrocytes. Oxidative stress induced by exogenous application of H2O2 (600 ??M) caused preferential damage of pyramidal neurons, while oxidative stress evoked with mercaptosuccinate (MCS; 400 ??M) or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; 4 ??M) mainly damaged astrocytes, as identified by propidium iodide fluorescence. Antioxidants (Trolox 500 ??M; MitoE 2 ??M) reduced both neuronal and astrocytic cell death. Blockers of TRPV4 channels (Gd3+ 500 ??M; Ruthenium red 1 ??M) increased the viability of astrocytes following MCS or BSO treatments, consistent with the expression pattern of these channels. Blockers of TRPM2 channels clotrimazole (20 ??M), N-(p-amylcinnomoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA, 25 ??M) or flufenamic acid (FFA, 200 ??M) failed to protect pyramidal neurons from damage caused by exogenous H2O2, and increased damage of these neurons caused by MCS and BSO. The differential expression of stress-sensitive TRPM2 and TRPV4 channels in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes that show distinct differences in vulnerability to different forms of oxidative stress suggests the specific involvement of these channels in oxidative stress-induced cell damage. However, the exact relationship between TRPM2 channel activation and cell death still remains to be determined due to the lack of protective effects of TRPM2 channel blockers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Although it is generally believed that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the precise role of these peptides in the development of memory loss of Alzheimer's disease, has not been fully understood. The present study examined the effect of several synthetic Abeta peptides on long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model of learning and memory, in rat hippocampal slices. Brief perfusion of slices with low concentrations (200 nM or 1 microM) of Abeta(1-42), Abeta(1-40) or their active fragment Abeta(25--35) significantly inhibited LTP induction without affecting the basal synaptic transmission and posttetanic potentiation in the dentate medial perforant path. A similar effect of Abeta(25-35) was also observed in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. When comparing actions of several Abeta variants derived from Abeta(25-35), the N-terminal sequence of Abeta(25-35) was found necessary for inhibiting LTP. In addition, Abeta variants lacking neurotoxic action and aggregating property were also able to block LTP, suggesting that this effect was neurotoxicity independent. Our findings demonstrated that subneurotoxic concentrations of Abeta peptides could strongly suppress long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Such an effect might underlie the memory deficits seen in Alzheimer's disease before neuronal cell loss.},

	Abstract = {Neural activity in the brain is accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation that are detectable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. In this paper, recent mathematical models of this hemodynamic response are reviewed and integrated. Models are described for: (1) the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal as a function of changes in cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (E) and cerebral blood volume (CBV); (2) the balloon model, proposed to describe the transient dynamics of CBV and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and how they affect the BOLD signal; (3) neurovascular coupling, relating the responses in CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 
                        2) to the neural activity response; and (4) a simple model for the temporal nonlinearity of the neural response itself. These models are integrated into a mathematical framework describing the steps linking a stimulus to the measured BOLD and CBF responses. Experimental results examining transient features of the BOLD response (post-stimulus undershoot and initial dip), nonlinearities of the hemodynamic response, and the role of the physiologic baseline state in altering the BOLD signal are discussed in the context of the proposed models. Quantitative modeling of the hemodynamic response, when combined with experimental data measuring both the BOLD and CBF responses, makes possible a more specific and quantitative assessment of brain physiology than is possible with standard BOLD imaging alone. This approach has the potential to enhance numerous studies of brain function in development, health, and disease. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of hemodynamic changes captured in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response contains information of brain activity. The BOLD response is the result of a complex neurovascular coupling and comes in at least two fundamentally different forms: a positive and a negative deflection. Because of the complexity of the signaling, mathematical modelling can provide vital help in the data analysis. For the positive BOLD response, there are plenty of mathematical models, both physiological and phenomenological. However, for the negative BOLD response, no physiologically based model exists. Here, we expand our previously developed physiological model with the most prominent mechanistic hypothesis for the negative BOLD response: the neural inhibition hypothesis. The model was trained and tested on experimental data containing both negative and positive BOLD responses from two studies: 1) a visual-motor task and 2) a working-memory task in conjunction with administration of the tranquilizer diazepam. Our model was able to predict independent validation data not used for training and provides a mechanistic underpinning for previously observed effects of diazepam. The new model moves our understanding of the negative BOLD response from qualitative reasoning to a quantitative systems-biology level, which can be useful both in basic research and in clinical use.},

	Abstract = {1. The validity of the macroscopic laws of ion diffusion was critically examined within the microenvironment of the extracellular space in the rat cerebellum using ion-selective micropipettes and ionophoretic point sources. 2. The concepts of volume averaging, volume fraction (alpha) and tortuosity (lambda) were defined and shown to be theoretically appropriate for quantifying diffusion in a complex medium such as the brain. 3. Diffusion studies were made with the cations tetramethylammonium and tetraethylammonium and the anions alpha-naphthalene sulphonate and hexafluoro-arsenate, all of which remained essentially extracellular during the measurements. Diffusion parameters were measured for a period of 50s and over distances of the order of 0.1 mm. 4. Measurements of the diffusion coefficients of the ions in agar gel gave values that were very close to those derivable from the literature, thus confirming the validity of the method. 5. Measurements in the cerebellum did not reveal any systematic influences of ionophoretic current strength, electrode separation, anisotropy, inhomogeneity, charge discrimination or uptake, within the limits tested. 6. The pooled data from measurements with all the ions gave alpha = 0.21 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- S.E. of mean) and lambda = 1.55 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- S.E. of mean). 7. These results show that the extracellular space occupies about 20{\%} of the rat cerebellum and that the diffusion coefficient for small monovalent extracellular ions is reduced by a factor of 2.4 (i.e. lambda 2) without regard to charge sign. The over-all effect of this is to increase the apparent strength of any ionic source in the cerebellum by a factor of lambda 2/alpha, about 12-fold in the present case, and to modify the time course of diffusion. 8. These conclusions confirm that the laws of macroscopic diffusion are closely obeyed in the cerebellum for small ions in the extracellular space, provided that volume fraction and tortuosity are explicitly taken into account. It is likely that these conclusions are generally applicable to other brain regions and other diffusing substances.},

	Abstract = {Calcium signalling in astrocytes couples changes in neural activity to alterations in cerebral blood flow by eliciting vasoconstriction or vasodilation of arterioles. However, the mechanism for how these opposite astrocyte influences provide appropriate changes in vessel tone within an environment that has dynamic metabolic requirements remains unclear. Here we show that the ability of astrocytes to induce vasodilations over vasoconstrictions relies on the metabolic state of the rat brain tissue. When oxygen availability is lowered and astrocyte calcium concentration is elevated, astrocyte glycolysis and lactate release are maximized. External lactate attenuates transporter-mediated uptake from the extracellular space of prostaglandin E(2), leading to accumulation and subsequent vasodilation. In conditions of low oxygen concentration extracellular adenosine also increases, which blocks astrocyte-mediated constriction, facilitating dilation. These data reveal the role of metabolic substrates in regulating brain blood flow and provide a mechanism for differential astrocyte control over cerebrovascular diameter during different states of brain activation.},

	Abstract = {Probing neural activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) relies upon understanding the hemodynamic response to changes in neural activity. Although existing studies have extensively characterized the temporal hemodynamic response, less is understood about the spatial and spatiotemporal hemodynamic responses. This study systematically characterizes the spatiotemporal response by deriving the hemodynamic response due to a short localized neural drive, i.e., the spatiotemporal hemodynamic response function (stHRF) from a physiological model of hemodynamics based on a poroelastic model of cortical tissue. In this study, the model's boundary conditions are clarified and a resulting nonlinear hemodynamic wave equation is derived. From this wave equation, damped linear hemodynamic waves are predicted from the stHRF. The main features of these waves depend on two physiological parameters: wave propagation speed, which depends on mean cortical stiffness, and damping which depends on effective viscosity. Some of these predictions were applied and validated in a companion study (Aquino et al., 2012). The advantages of having such a theory for the stHRF include improving the interpretation of spatiotemporal dynamics in fMRI data; improving estimates of neural activity with fMRI spatiotemporal deconvolution; and enabling wave interactions between hemodynamic waves to be predicted and exploited to improve the signal to noise ratio of fMRI. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP in the coupling of neuronal activation to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. Whisker deflection (60 s) increased rCBF by 18 +/- 3{\%}. NO synthase (NOS) inhibition by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; topically) reduced the rCBF response to 9 +/- 4{\%} and resting rCBF to 80 +/- 8{\%}. NO donors [S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; 50 microM), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (10 microM)] or 8-bromoguanosine 3', 5'-cyclic-monophosphate (8-BrcGMP; 100 microM)] restored resting rCBF and L-NNA-induced attenuation of the whisker response in the presence of L-NNA, whereas the NO-independent vasodilator papaverine (1 mM) had no effect on the whisker response. Basal cGMP levels were decreased to 35{\%} by L-NNA and restored to 65{\%} of control by subsequent SNAP superfusion. Inhibition of neuronal NOS by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 40 mg/kg ip) or soluble guanylyl cyclase by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 100 microM) significantly reduced resting rCBF to 86 +/- 8 and 92 +/- 10{\%} and whisker rCBF response to 7 +/- 4 and 12 +/- 3{\%}, respectively. ODQ reduced tissue cGMP to 54{\%}. 8-BrcGMP restored the whisker response in the presence of 7-NI or ODQ. We conclude that NO, produced by neuronal NOS, is a modulator in the coupling of neuronal activation and rCBF in rat somatosensory cortex and that this effect is mainly mediated by cGMP. L-NNA-induced vasomotion was significantly reduced during increased neuronal activity and after restoration of basal NO levels, but not after restoration of cGMP.},

	Abstract = {Shear stress causes the vascular endothelium to release nitric oxide (NO), which is an important regulator of vascular tone. However, direct measurement of NO release after the imposition of laminar flow has not been previously accomplished because of chemical (oxidative degradation) and physical (diffusion, convection, and washout) complications. Consequently, the mechanism, time course, kinetics, and Ca2+ dependence of NO release due to shear stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we characterized these parameters by using fura 2 fluorescence and a polymeric porphyrin/Nafion-coated carbon fiber microsensor (detection limit, 5 nmol/L; response time, 1 millisecond) to directly measure changes in [Ca2+], and NO release due to shear stress or agonist (ATP or brominated Ca2+ ionophore [Br-A23187]) from bovine aortic endothelial cells. The cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips, loaded with fura 2-AM, and mounted in a parallel-plate flow chamber (volume, 25 $\mu$L). The microsensor was positioned ≃100 $\mu$m above the cells with its long axis parallel to the direction of flow. Laminar flow of perfusate was maintained from 0.04 to 1.90 mL/min, which produced shear stresses of 0.2 to 10 dyne/cm2. Shear stress caused transient NO release 3 to 5 seconds after the initiation of flow and 1 to 3 seconds after the rise in [Ca2+](i), which reached a plateau after 35 to 70 seconds. Although the amount (peak rate) of NO release increased as a function of the shear stress (0.08 to 3.80 pmol/s), because of the concomitant increase in the flow rate, the peak NO concentration (133$\pm$9 nmol/L) remained constant. Maintenance of flow resulted in additional transient NO release, with peak-to-peak intervals of 15.5$\pm$2.5 minutes. During this 13- to 18-minute period, when the cells were unresponsive to shear stress, exogenous ATP (10 $\mu$mol/L) or Br-A23187 (10 $\mu$mol/L) evoked NO release. Prior incubation of the cells with exogenous NO or the removal and EGTA (100 $\mu$mol/L) chelation of extracellular Ca2+ blocked shear stress but not ATP-dependent NO release. The kinetics of shear stress-induced NO release (2.23$\pm$0.07 nmol/L per second) closely resembled the kinetics of Ca2+ flux but differed markedly from the kinetics of ATP-induced NO release (5.64$\pm$0.32 nmol/L per second). These data argue that shear stress causes a Ca2+- mediated ATP-independent transient release of NO, where the peak rate of release but not the peak concentration depends on the level of shear stress. The transient nature of this response may be due to NO-induced inhibition of Ca2+ influx via a mechanism yet to be determined.},

	Abstract = {Neuron-glia signaling is important for neural development and functions. This signaling may be regulated by neuronal activity and undergo modification similar to long-term potentiation (LTP) of neuronal synapses, a hallmark of neuronal plasticity. We found that tetanic stimulation of Schaffer collaterals (Sc) in the hippocampus that induced LTP in neurons also resulted in LTP-like persistent elevation of Sc-evoked slow depolarization in perisynaptic astrocytes. The elevated slow depolarization in astrocytes was abolished by NMDA receptor antagonist and K(+) channel inhibitors, but not by Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA loaded in the recorded astrocytes, suggesting involvement of an increased extracellular K(+) accumulation accompanying LTP of neuronal synapses. The increased K(+) accumulation and astrocyte depolarization after LTP induction may reduce the efficiency of glial glutamate transporters, which may contribute to the enhanced synaptic efficacy. The neuronal activity-induced persistent enhancement of neuron-glia signaling may thus have important physiological relevance.},

	Abstract = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) is affected in many neurological conditions. Clinical measurement of pressure on the brain currently requires placing a probe in the cerebrospinal fluid compartment, the brain tissue, or other intracranial space. This invasiveness limits the measurement to critically ill patients. Because ICP is also clinically important in conditions ranging from brain tumors and hydrocephalus to concussions, noninvasive determination of ICP would be desirable. Our model-based approach to continuous estimation and tracking of ICP uses routinely obtainable time-synchronized, noninvasive (or minimally invasive) measurements of peripheral arterial blood pressure and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), both at intra-heartbeat resolution. A physiological model of cerebrovascular dynamics provides mathematical constraints that relate the measured waveforms to ICP. Our algorithm produces patient-specific ICP estimates with no calibration or training. Using 35 hours of data from 37 patients with traumatic brain injury, we generated ICP estimates on 2665 nonoverlapping 60-beat data windows. Referenced against concurrently recorded invasive parenchymal ICP that varied over 100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) across all records, our estimates achieved a mean error (bias) of 1.6 mmHg and SD of error (SDE) of 7.6 mmHg. For the 1673 data windows over 22 hours in which blood flow velocity recordings were available from both the left and the right MCA, averaging the resulting bilateral ICP estimates reduced the bias to 1.5 mmHg and SDE to 5.9 mmHg. This accuracy is already comparable to that of some invasive ICP measurement methods in current clinical use.},

	Abstract = {The three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the cortical microcirculatory system is critical for understanding oxygen exchange between blood vessels and brain cells. A three-dimensional computer model of a 3 × 3 × 3 mm(3) subsection of the human secondary cortex was constructed to quantify oxygen advection in the microcirculation, tissue oxygen perfusion, and consumption in the human cortex. This computer model accounts for all arterial, capillary and venous blood vessels of the cerebral microvascular bed as well as brain tissue occupying the extravascular space. Microvessels were assembled with optimization algorithms emulating angiogenic growth; a realistic capillary bed was built with space filling procedures. The extravascular tissue was modeled as a porous medium supplied with oxygen by advection-diffusion to match normal metabolic oxygen demand. The resulting synthetic computer generated network matches prior measured morphometrics and fractal patterns of the cortical microvasculature. This morphologically accurate, physiologically consistent, multi-scale computer network of the cerebral microcirculation predicts the oxygen exchange of cortical blood vessels with the surrounding gray matter. Oxygen tension subject to blood pressure and flow conditions were computed and validated for the blood as well as brain tissue. Oxygen gradients along arterioles, capillaries and veins agreed with in vivo trends observed recently in imaging studies within experimental tolerances and uncertainty.},

@article{Dormanns2015d,
	Abstract = {The human brain critically relies on a continuous blood supply to ensure its function. Impaired cerebral perfusion is associated with diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, cortical spreading depression and stroke. Cerebral cells work together to ensure a finely regulated blood supply. However, many of the underlying mechanisms of this regulation, termed neurovascular coupling (NVC), are still not fully understood. The development of mathematical models of cell signalling is a promising approach that complements experimental studies by investigating the contribution of key components and pathways and guiding further experiments. This dissertation reports the development of a lumped parameter compartment model of a neurovascular unit (NVU), comprising neurons, astrocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The model couples neuronal activity to vasodilation/contraction models via the an astrocytic mediated perivascular K+ and the a smooth muscle Ca2+ pathway. It successfully relates a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. It was found that the voltage-operated Ca2+ channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from the K+ efflux of the SMC, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that in contrast to a number of experiments, outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca2+ in NVC, this Ca2+ pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Model inputs from the endothelial side of the blood vessel in form of luminal agonists provide a flux of IP3 into the EC cytosol. EC/SMC coupling through gap junctions has a substantial effect on the NVC dynamics. The IP3 influx induces Ca2+ release from the SMC stores resulting in Ca2+induced Ca2+ release oscillations which were shown to inhibit NVC. The incorporation of nitric oxide (NO) signalling pathways in the NVU model shows the vasodilating effects of NO in the resting state. Furthermore, dilation during neuronal activation is enhanced with NO dynamics included. Results show that K+ release is responsible for the fast onset of vascular response, whereas NO-modulated mechanisms maintain dilation. The govern- ing source of NO that diffuses into the SMC, which provides the contractile force, depends on neuronal activation. In the resting state the EC provides the major contribution of NO release for vasorelaxation, whereas during neuronal stimulation NO produced by the NE dominates. In a scaled model, embedded in a parallel computing environment, multiple NVUs were connected to a space filling binary tree, facilitating the simulation of a perfusing vascular tree. The model couples the NVUs to the vasculature via stretch-mediated Ca2+ channels on both the EC and SMC . The coupling between the vasculature and the set of NVUs was found to be relatively weak for the case with agonist induced where only the Ca2+ in cells inside the activated area becomes oscillatory. However, the radii of vessels both inside and outside of activated areas oscillate (albeit small for those outside). In addition, simulations reveal a different oscillation profile when comparing coupled and decoupled states with the time required to refill the cytosol with decreasing Ca2+ and increasing frequency with coupling. The solution algorithm is shown to have excellent weak and strong scaling. Results have been generated for tissue slices containing up to 4096 NVUs, which corresponds to an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm of cerebral tissue.},

	Abstract = {Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) exhibit different types of calcium dynamics. Static vascular tone is associated with unsynchronized calcium waves and the developed force depends on the number of recruited cells. Global calcium transients synchronized among a large number of cells cause rhythmic development of force known as vasomotion. We present experimental data showing a considerable heterogeneity in cellular calcium dynamics in the vascular wall. In stimulated vessels, some SMCs remain quiescent, whereas others display waves of variable frequency. At the onset of vasomotion, all SMCs are enrolled into synchronized oscillation. Simulations of coupled SMCs show that the experimentally observed cellular recruitment, the presence of quiescent cells and the variation in oscillation frequency may arise if the cell population is phenotypically heterogeneous. In this case, quiescent cells can be entrained at the onset of vasomotion by the collective driving force from the synchronized oscillations in the membrane potential of the surrounding cells. Partial synchronization arises with an increase in the concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, but in a heterogeneous cell population complete synchronization also requires a high-conductance pathway that provides strong coupling between the cells.},

In this review, the participation of the BBB in the amyloid cascade and in other mechanisms of AD neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will specifically focus on three aspects of BBB dysfunction: disruption, perturbation of transporters, and secretion of neurotoxic substances by the BBB. We will also discuss the interaction of the BBB with components of the neurovascular unit in relation to AD and the potential contribution of AD risk factors to aspects of BBB dysfunction. From the results discussed herein, we conclude that BBB dysfunction contributes to AD through a number of mechanisms that could be initiated in the presence or absence of A{\$}\beta{\$} pathology.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channels are expressed in brain endothelial cells, but their role in regulating cerebrovascular tone under physiological and pathological conditions is still largely unknown.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Wild-type (WT) mice and mice that overexpress a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP mice, model of increased amyloid {\$}\beta{\$}), a constitutively active form of TGF-{\$}\beta{\$}1 (TGF mice, model of cerebrovascular fibrosis) or both (APP/TGF mice) were used. Dilations to the selective TRPV4 channel opener GSK1016790A (GSK) or to ACh were measured in posterior cerebral artery segments.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nKEY RESULTS: Both GSK- and ACh-induced dilations virtually disappeared following endothelium denudation in WT mice. These responses were impaired in vessels from APP, TGF and APP/TGF mice compared with WT. Pre-incubation of WT vessels with the selective TRPV4 channel blocker HC-067047, or with small-conductance (SK channel, apamin) and/or intermediate-conductance (IK channel, charybdotoxin, ChTx) Ca(2+) -sensitive K(+) channel blocker abolished GSK-induced dilations and massively decreased those induced by ACh. These treatments had no or limited effects on ACh-induced dilation in vessels from APP, TGF or APP/TGF mice, and IK and SK channel function was preserved in transgenic mice. Antioxidant superoxide dismutase or catalase normalized GSK- and ACh-mediated dilations only in APP brain arteries.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that endothelial TRPV4 channels mediate ACh-induced dilation in cerebral arteries, that they are impaired in models of cerebrovascular pathology and that they are sensitive, albeit in the reversible manner, to amyloid {\$}\beta{\$}-induced oxidative stress.},

	Abstract = {Impaired cerebral autoregulation leads to fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, which can be especially dangerous for immature brain of preterm newborns. In this paper, two mathematical models of cerebral autoregulation are discussed. The first one is an enhancement of a vascular model proposed by Piechnik et al. We extend this model by adding a polynomial dependence of the vascular radius on the arterial blood pressure and adjusting the polynomial coefficients to experimental data to gain the autoregulation behavior. Moreover, the inclusion of a Preisach hysteresis operator, simulating a hysteretic dependence of the cerebral blood flow on the arterial pressure, is tested. The second model couples the blood vessel system model by Piechnik et al. with an ordinary differential equation model of cerebral autoregulation by Ursino and Lodi. An optimal control setting is proposed for a simplified variant of this coupled model. The objective of the control is the maintenance of the autoregulatory function for a wider range of the arterial pressure. The control can be interpreted as the effect of a medicament changing the cerebral blood flow by, for example, dilation of blood vessels. Advanced numerical methods developed by the authors are applied for the numerical treatment of the control problem.},

	Abstract = {This study examined the effects of a 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) antagonist, 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(Z),15(Z)-dienoic acid (WIT002) and two agonists, 4-amino-N-(20-hydroxy-eicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoyl) benzenesulfonamide (ABSA) and 20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoic acid (WIT003), on the diameter of rat middle cerebral arteries in vitro and on cerebral blood flow in vivo. WIT003, ABSA and 20-HETE all had a similar effect to reduce the diameter of the middle cerebral artery by 26{\%}. WIT003 and 20-HETE both increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from the middle cerebral artery. In contrast, WIT002 had no effect on the basal diameter of the middle cerebral artery but it attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses and the rise in [Ca2+]i in vascular smooth muscle cells following administration of 20-HETE and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). WIT003 partially restored the vasoconstrictor response to 5-HT in the middle cerebral artery after administration of an inhibitor of the endogenous synthesis of 20-HETE. Infusion of the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, into cisterna magna of rats reduced baseline cerebral blood flow by 20{\%}, whereas administration of the 20-HETE antagonist, WIT002, had no effect. Intracisternal injection of WIT002 attenuated the fall in cerebral blood flow following injection of blood into the cisterna magna, whereas administration of the 20-HETE agonist, ABSA, potentiated this response. These findings indicate that the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, increase cerebral vascular tone both in vivo and in vitro and suggest blocking the vasoconstrictor actions of 20-HETE may be useful to prevent the acute fall in cerebral blood flow following subarachnoid hemorrhage.},

@article{Shaikh2012,
	Abstract = {Impaired mass transfer characteristics of blood-borne vasoactive species such as adenosine triphosphate in regions such as an arterial bifurcation have been hypothesized as a prospective mechanism in the aetiology of atherosclerotic lesions. Arterial endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) respond differentially to altered local haemodynamics and produce coordinated macro-scale responses via intercellular communication. Using a computationally designed arterial segment comprising large populations of mathematically modelled coupled ECs and SMCs, we investigate their response to spatial gradients of blood-borne agonist concentrations and the effect of micro-scale-driven perturbation on the macro-scale. Altering homocellular (between same cell type) and heterocellular (between different cell types) intercellular coupling, we simulated four cases of normal and pathological arterial segments experiencing an identical gradient in the concentration of the agonist. Results show that the heterocellular calcium (Ca(2+)) coupling between ECs and SMCs is important in eliciting a rapid response when the vessel segment is stimulated by the agonist gradient. In the absence of heterocellular coupling, homocellular Ca(2+) coupling between SMCs is necessary for propagation of Ca(2+) waves from downstream to upstream cells axially. Desynchronized intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations in coupled SMCs are mandatory for this propagation. Upon decoupling the heterocellular membrane potential, the arterial segment looses the inhibitory effect of ECs on the Ca(2+) dynamics of the underlying SMCs. The full system comprises hundreds of thousands of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations simulated on the massively parallel Blue Gene architecture. The use of massively parallel computational architectures shows the capability of this approach to address macro-scale phenomena driven by elementary micro-scale components of the system.},

@article{Wiesner1997,
	Abstract = {Important among the responses of endothelial cells to flow stimuli are cytosolic-free calcium transients. These transients are mediated by several factors, including blood-borne agonists, extracellular calcium, and fluid-imposed shear forces. A mathematical model has been developed describing the recognition and transduction of shear stress to the second messenger cytosolic calcium. Shear stress modulates the calcium response via at least two modalities. First, mass transfer of agonist to the cell surface is enhanced by perfusion and is thus related to shear stress. Second, the permeability of the cell membrane to extracellular calcium increases upon exposure to shear stress. A mass balance for agonist in the perfusate is coupled to a previously published calcium dynamics model. Computations indicate a flow region where the transient moves from transport limited to kinetically limited. Parametric studies indicate distinct contributions to the time course by each step in the process. These steps include the time to develop the concentration boundary layer of agonist, receptor activation, and the mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. Exogenous calcium is presumed to enter the cell via shear stress-gated ion channels. The model predicts a sigmoidal dependence of calcium influx upon shear stress. The peak value of the transient is determined largely by the agonist pathway, whereas the plateau level is governed by calcium influx. The model predicts the modulation of the calcium transient in the physiologically relevant range of flow and the associated shear stress. This implies that hemodynamics is important in regulating endothelial biology.},

	Abstract = {The ability of neuroglia to buffer local increases of extracellular K(+) has been known from in vitro studies. This property may confer on these cells an active role in the modulation and spreading of cortical oscillatory activities. We addressed the question of the spatial buffering in vivo by performing single and double intraglial recordings, together with measures of the extracellular K(+) and Ca(2+) concentrations ([K(+)](out) and [Ca(2+)](out)) in the cerebral cortex of cats under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia during patterns of slow sleep oscillations and spike-wave seizures. In addition, we estimated the fluctuations of intraglial K(+) concentrations ([K(+)](in)). Measurements obtained during the slow oscillation indicated that glial cells phasically take up part of the extracellular K(+) extruded by neurons during the depolarizing phase of the slow oscillation. During this condition, the redistribution of K(+) appeared to be local. Large steady increases of [K(+)](out) and phasic potassium accumulations were measured during spike-wave seizures. In this condition, [K(+)](in) rose before [K(+)](out) if the glial cells were located at some distance from the epileptic focus, suggesting faster K(+) diffusion through the interglial syncytium. The simultaneously recorded [Ca(2+)](out) dropped steadily during the seizures to levels incompatible with efficient synaptic transmission, but also displayed periodic oscillations, in phase with the intraseizure spike-wave complexes. In view of this fact, and considering the capability of K(+) to modulate neuronal excitability both at the presynaptic and postsynaptic levels, we suggest that the K(+) long-range spatial buffering operated by glia is a parallel synchronizing and/or spreading mechanism during paroxysmal oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal activity results in increased blood flow in the brain, a response named functional hyperemia. Astrocytes play an important role in mediating this response. Neurotransmitters released from active neurons evoke Ca2þ increases in astrocytes, leading to the release of vasoactive metabolites of arachidonic acid from astrocyte endfeet onto blood vessels. Synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) dilate blood vessels, whereas 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) constricts vessels. The release of Kþ from astrocyte endfeet may also contribute to vasodilation. Oxygen modulates astrocyte regulation of blood flow. Under normoxic conditions, astrocytic Ca2þ signaling results in vasodilation, whereas under hyperoxic conditions, vasoconstriction is favored. Astrocytes also contribute to the generation of vascular tone. Tonic release of both 20- HETE and ATP from astrocytes constricts vascular smooth muscle cells, generating vessel tone. Under pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and diabetic reti- nopathy, disruption of normal astrocyte physiology can compromise the regulation of blood flow},

	Abstract = {Oxygen is delivered to brain tissue by a dense network of microvessels, which actively control cerebral blood flow (CBF) through vasodilation and contraction in response to changing levels of neural activity. Understanding these network-level processes is immediately relevant for (1) interpretation of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals, and (2) investigation of neurological diseases in which a deterioration of neurovascular and neuro-metabolic physiology contributes to motor and cognitive decline. Experimental data on the structure, flow and oxygen levels of microvascular networks are needed, together with theoretical methods to integrate this information and predict physiologically relevant properties that are not directly measurable. Recent progress in optical imaging technologies for high-resolution in vivo measurement of the cerebral microvascular architecture, blood flow, and oxygenation enables construction of detailed computational models of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen transport based on realistic three-dimensional microvascular networks. In this article, we review state-of-the-art optical microscopy technologies for quantitative in vivo imaging of cerebral microvascular structure, blood flow and oxygenation, and theoretical methods that utilize such data to generate spatially resolved models for blood flow and oxygen transport. These ``bottom-up'' models are essential for the understanding of the processes governing brain oxygenation in normal and disease states and for eventual translation of the lessons learned from animal studies to humans.},

We examine the errors associated with the typical parameter estimation method for these data and show them to be unsatisfactorally large especially if the time constants of activation and inactivation are not sufficiently separated. The size of these errors is due to the fact that the steady-state and kinetic properties of the current are estimated disjointly.

@article{Li2005,
	Abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the oxidation of one l-arginine guanidinium N atom to nitric oxide (NO). NOS consists of a heme domain linked to a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)/flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) reductase that shuttles electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to the heme. This review summarizes various aspects of NOS structure and function derived from crystal structures coupled with a wealth of biochemical and biophysical data. This includes the binding of diatomic ligands, especially the product, NO, whose binding to the heme iron blocks enzyme activity. An unusual feature of NOS catalysis is the strict requirement for the essential cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (H 
                        4B). It now is generally agreed that H 
                        4B serves as an electron donor to the heme-oxy complex. The reason NOS may have recruited H 
                        4B as an electron transfer cofactor is to provide rapid coupled proton/electron transfer required for O 
                        2 activation. NOS is a highly regulated enzyme which is controlled by calmodulin (CaM) at the level of electron transfer within the FMN/FAD reductase and between the reductase and heme domains. Recent crystal structures provide a basis for developing models on the structural underpinnings of NOS regulation. In addition to the complex and fascinating functional and regulatory features of NOS, NOS is an important therapeutic target. Crystal structures have revealed the structural basis of isoform-selective inhibition by a group of dipeptide inhibitors which opens the way for structure-based inhibitor design. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {An important issue in synaptic physiology is the extent to which postsynaptic receptors are saturated by the neurotransmitter released from a single synaptic vesicle. Although the bulk of evidence supports receptor saturation, recent studies have started to reveal that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may not be saturated by a single vesicle of glutamate. Here, we address this question through a study of putative single synapses, made by hippocampal neurons in culture, that are identified by FM1-43 staining. An analysis of the sources of variability in the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at single synapses reveals that this variability must arise presynaptically, from variations in the quantity of agonist released. Thus, glutamate receptors at hippocampal synapses are not generally saturated by quantal release.},

how pulsatile flow effects mass transfer, observing both mean and

transport of low diffusion coefficient species, the realistic geometry
leads to very different mass transfer characteristics. These include
spiral patterns in the distribution of low concentration fluid. Furthermore,
the mean ATP distribution was found to be elevated compared with
the steady state; this is attributed to the effects of convective
mixing. The results strongly implicate that under certain conditions
mass transport in pulsatile flow exhibits different hydrolysis characteristics
at the endothelium compared with steady state. Transient variations
throughout the the cardiac cycle were found to be small. This small
transient response is primarily due to low ATP diffusivity.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal activity evokes localized changes in blood flow. Although this response, termed neurovascular coupling, is widely used to monitor human brain function and diagnose pathology, the cellular mechanisms that mediate the response remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of glial cells to neurovascular coupling in the acutely isolated mammalian retina. We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of omega-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.},

@article{DeWit2006,
	Abstract = {Cellular interaction in vessels is achieved by multiple communication pathways, including gap junctions (GJs). They provide intercellular channels, allowing direct interaction of endothelial and smooth muscle cells and the coordination of cellular behaviour along the vessel. The latter is a prerequisite for large flow increases because an adaptation of resistance along the vessel length is required. Longitudinal communication is studied by confined local stimulation of arterioles and the observation of responses at distant locations. Certain vascular stimuli induce local and concomitant remote responses of a similar type, verifying rapid longitudinal conduction of vasomotor signals, most likely changes in membrane potential. This is achieved for dilatory responses via the endothelium, possibly by an endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF) that induces local hyperpolarisation, which is then transferred to remote sites through GJs. In vessels, GJs are composed of different connexins (Cx), but Cx40 is of special importance because its lack impairs longitudinal conduction of vasodilations. Interestingly, Cx40-deficient mice are hypertensive, suggesting that Cx40-dependent coupling is necessary to regulate vascular behaviour and peripheral resistance. While the role of other connexins is less well established, an abundance of data has proven the necessity of GJ communication to coordinate vascular behaviour during blood flow regulation.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms by which flow-imposed shear stress elevates intracellular Ca2+ in cultured endothelial cells (ECs) are not fully understood. Here we report finding that endogenously released ATP contributes to shear stress-induced Ca2+ responses. Application of flow of Hanks' balanced solution to human pulmonary artery ECs (HPAECs) elicited shear stress-dependent increases in Ca2+ concentrations. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA completely abolished the Ca2+ responses, whereas the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 or the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin had no effect, which thereby indicates that the response was due to the influx of extracellular Ca2+. The Ca2+ influx was significantly suppressed by apyrase, which degrades ATP, or antisense oligonucleotide targeted to P2X4 purinoceptors. A luciferase luminometric assay showed that shear stress induced dose-dependent release of ATP. When the ATP release was inhibited by the ATP synthase inhibitors angiostatin or oligomycin, the Ca2+ influx was markedly suppressed but was restored by removal of these inhibitors or addition of extracellular ATP. These results suggest that shear stress stimulates HPAECs to release ATP, which activates Ca2+ influx via P2X4 receptors.},

	Abstract = {Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is the most commonly used noninvasive method for the assessment of vascular endothelial function; this assessment uses the magnitude of vasodilation according to reactive hyperemia. The physiological mechanism of vasodilation has been well studied; it was recently hypothesized that endothelial function can reversibly be estimated by computational analysis. This leads to more reliable information about cardiovascular risk factors. In this study, we first developed a mathematical model of vasodilation involving both intra- and inter-cellular pathways, which is constructed by integrating small-scale models based on known physiological mechanisms. We evaluated the proposed model with respect to several aspects: reproducibility of the FMD response; analysis of the relationship between FMD and endothelial function; and analysis of underlying mechanisms of low flowmediated constriction. We confirmed that the simulated results corresponded well with those observed physiologically. Therefore, the results of the present study show that the proposed model has sufficient capability to quantitatively analyze FMD. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Stroke is the neurological evidence of a critical reduction of cerebral blood flow in a circumscribed part of the brain, resulting from the sudden or gradually progressing obstruction of a large brain artery. Treatment of stroke requires the solid understanding of stroke pathophysiology and involves a broad range of hemodynamic and molecular interventions. This review summarizes research that has been carried out in many laboratories over a long period of time, but the main focus will be on own experimental research. 2. The first chapter deals with the hemodynamics of focal ischemia with particular emphasis on the collateral circulation of the brain, the regulation of blood flow and the microcirculation. In the second chapter the penumbra concept of ischemia is discussed, providing a detailed list of the physiological, biochemical and structural viability thresholds of ischemia and examples of how these thresholds can be applied for imaging the penumbra. The third chapter summarizes the pathophysiology of infarct progression, focusing on the role of peri-infarct depolarisation, the multitude of putative molecular injury pathways, brain edema and inflammation. Finally, the fourth chapter provides an overview of currently discussed therapeutic approaches, notably the effect of mechanical or thrombolytic reperfusion, arteriogenesis, pharmacological neuroprotection, ischemic preconditioning and regeneration. 3. The main emphasis of the review is placed on the balanced differentiation between hemodynamic and molecular factors contributing to the manifestation of ischemic injury in order to provide a rational basis for future therapeutic interventions.},

	Abstract = {Glia in the central nervous system (CNS) express diverse inward rectifying potassium channels (Kir). The major function of Kir is in establishing the high potassium (K+) selectivity of the glial cell membrane and strongly negative resting membrane potential (RMP), which are characteristic physiological properties of glia. The classical property of Kir is that K+ flows inwards when the RMP is negative to the equilibrium potential for K+ (E(K)), but at more positive potentials outward currents are inhibited. This provides the driving force for glial uptake of K+ released during neuronal activity, by the processes of "K+ spatial buffering" and "K+ siphoning", considered a key function of astrocytes, the main glial cell type in the CNS. Glia express multiple Kir channel subtypes, which are likely to have distinct functional roles related to their differences in conductance, and sensitivity to intracellular and extracellular factors, including pH, ATP, G-proteins, neurotransmitters and hormones. A feature of CNS glia is their specific expression of the Kir4.1 subtype, which is a major K+ conductance in glial cell membranes and has a key role in setting the glial RMP. It is proposed that Kir4.1 have a primary function in K+ regulation, both as homomeric channels and as heteromeric channels by co-assembly with Kir5.1 and probably Kir2.0 subtypes. Significantly, Kir4.1 are also expressed by oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the CNS, and the genetic ablation of Kir4.1 results in severe hypomyelination. Hence, Kir, and in particular Kir4.1, are key regulators of glial functions, which in turn determine neuronal excitability and axonal conduction.},

	Abstract = {Treatment options for stroke remain limited. Neuroprotective therapies, in particular, have invariably failed to yield the expected benefit in stroke patients, despite robust theoretical and mechanistic background and promising animal data. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) play a pivotal role in critical brain functions, such as energy homeostasis, neuronal growth, and differentiation. They may exhibit neuroprotective properties in acute ischemic stroke based upon their vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects, as well as improvements of functional connectivity, neuronal metabolism, neurotransmitter regulation, and remyelination. Intranasally administered insulin has demonstrated a benefit for prevention of cognitive decline in older people, and IGF-1 has shown potential benefit to improve functional outcomes in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. The intranasal route presents a feasible, tolerable, safe, and particularly effective administration route, bypassing the blood-brain barrier and maximizing distribution to the central nervous system (CNS), without the disadvantages of systemic side effects and first-pass metabolism. This review summarizes the neuroprotective potential of intranasally administered insulin and IGF-1 in stroke patients. We present the theoretical background and pathophysiologic mechanisms, animal and human studies of intranasal insulin and IGF-1, and the safety and feasibility of intranasal route for medication administration to the CNS.},

@article{Roman2002,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that arachidonic acid is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes in the brain, lung, kidney, and peripheral vasculature to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and that these compounds play critical roles in the regulation of renal, pulmonary, and cardiac function and vascular tone. EETs are endothelium-derived vasodilators that hyperpolarize vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells by activating K(+) channels. 20-HETE is a vasoconstrictor produced in VSM cells that reduces the open-state probability of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. Inhibitors of the formation of 20-HETE block the myogenic response of renal, cerebral, and skeletal muscle arterioles in vitro and autoregulation of renal and cerebral blood flow in vivo. They also block tubuloglomerular feedback responses in vivo and the vasoconstrictor response to elevations in tissue PO(2) both in vivo and in vitro. The formation of 20-HETE in VSM is stimulated by angiotensin II and endothelin and is inhibited by nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Blockade of the formation of 20-HETE attenuates the vascular responses to angiotensin II, endothelin, norepinephrine, NO, and CO. In the kidney, EETs and 20-HETE are produced in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending loop of Henle. They regulate Na(+) transport in these nephron segments. 20-HETE also contributes to the mitogenic effects of a variety of growth factors in VSM, renal epithelial, and mesangial cells. The production of EETs and 20-HETE is altered in experimental and genetic models of hypertension, diabetes, uremia, toxemia of pregnancy, and hepatorenal syndrome. Given the importance of this pathway in the control of cardiovascular function, it is likely that CYP metabolites of arachidonic acid contribute to the changes in renal function and vascular tone associated with some of these conditions and that drugs that modify the formation and/or actions of EETs and 20-HETE may have therapeutic benefits.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than 18 million people worldwide and is characterized by progressive memory deficits, cognitive impairment and personality changes. The main cause of AD is generally attributed to the increased production and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), in association with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory factors such as cytokines and chemokines, and the activation of the complement cascade occurs in the brains of AD patients and contributes to the local inflammatory response triggered by senile plaque. The existence of an inflammatory component in AD is now well known on the basis of epidemiological findings showing a reduced prevalence of the disease upon long-term medication with anti-inflammatory drugs, and evidence from studies of clinical materials that shows an accumulation of activated glial cells, particularly microglia and astrocytes, in the same areas as amyloid plaques. Glial cells maintain brain plasticity and protect the brain for functional recovery from injuries. Dysfunction of glial cells may promote neurodegeneration and, eventually, the retraction of neuronal synapses, which leads to cognitive deficits. The focus of this review is on glial cells and their diversity properties in AD.},

	Abstract = {To investigate possible effects of diffusion on alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) transport in axons, we developed two models of alpha-syn transport, one that assumes that alpha-syn is transported only by active transport, as part of multiprotein complexes, and a second that assumes an interplay between motor-driven and diffusion-driven alpha-syn transport. By comparing predictions of the two models, we were able to investigate how diffusion could influence axonal transport of alpha-syn. The predictions obtained could be useful for future experimental work aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of axonal transport of alpha-syn. We also attempted to simulate possible defects in alpha-syn transport early in Parkinson's disease (PD). We assumed that in healthy axons alpha-syn localizes in the axon terminal while in diseased axons alpha-syn does not localize in the terminal (this was simulated by postulating a zero alpha-syn flux into the terminal). We found that our model of a diseased axon predicts the build-up of alpha-syn close to the axon terminal. This build-up could cause alpha-syn accumulation in Lewy bodies and the subsequent axonal death pattern observed in PD ('dying back' of axons).},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), a free gaseous signaling molecule, is involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular, nervous and immune system. The neurotransmitter function of nitric oxide is dependent on dynamic regulation of its biosynthetic enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS). There are three types of NOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Of the three NOS, we focus on nNOS in the present review. Brain nNOS exists in particulate and soluble forms and the differential subcellular localization of nNOS may contribute to its diverse functions. Proteins bearing PDZ domains can interact directly with the PDZ domain of nNOS, influencing the subcellular distribution and/or activity of the enzyme. During the past several years, an increasing number of reports have demonstrated the importance of nNOS in a variety of synaptic signaling events. nNOS has been implicated in modulating physiological functions such as learning, memory, and neurogenesis, as well as being involved in a number of human diseases. In this review we concentrate on recent findings regarding the structural features, subcellular localization and factors regulating nNOS function. In particular, we conclude with a section discussing the role of nNOS in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions.},

	Abstract = {In contrast to traditional neuroncentric views of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent findings indicate that neurovascular dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD. Here, I propose the neurovascular hypothesis of AD, suggesting that faulty clearance of amyloid ?? peptide (A??) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), aberrant angiogenesis and senescence of the cerebrovascular system could initiate neurovascular uncoupling, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion and neurovascular inflammation. Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A?? clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Flow-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells plays a fundamental role in vascular homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which shear stress activates NO production remain unclear due in part to limitations in measuring NO, especially under flow conditions. Shear stress elicits the release of ATP, but the relative contribution of autocrine stimulation by ATP to flow-induced NO production has not been established. Furthermore, the importance of calcium in shear stress-induced NO production remains controversial, and in particular the role of capacitive calcium entry (CCE) has yet to be determined. We have utilized our unique NO measurement device to investigate the role of ATP autocrine signaling and CCE in shear stress-induced NO production. We found that endogenously released ATP and downstream activation of purinergic receptors and CCE plays a significant role in shear stress-induced NO production. ATP-induced eNOS phophorylation under static conditions is also dependent on CCE. Inhibition of protein kinase C significantly inhibited eNOS phosphorylation and the calcium response. To our knowledge, we are the first to report on the role of CCE in the mechanism of acute shear stress-induced NO response. In addition, our work highlights the importance of ATP autocrine signaling in shear stress-induced NO production.},

However, it is unknown whether the vascular and metabolic responses within a given brain area differ when local neuronal activity is evoked by an activity in the distinct neuronal networks. In this study we assessed, for the first time, the differences in neuronal responses and changes in CBF and oxygen consumption that are evoked after the activation of two different inputs to a single cortical area. We show that, for a given level of glutamatergic synaptic activity, corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs evoked activity in pyramidal cells and different classes of interneurons, and produced different changes in oxygen consumption and CBF. Furthermore, increases in stimulation intensities either turned off or activated additional classes of inhibitory interneurons immunoreactive for different vasoactive molecules, which may contribute to increases in CBF. Our data imply that for a given cortical area, the amplitude of vascular signals will depend critically on the type of input, and that a positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal may be a consequence of the activation of both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons.},

	Abstract = {The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine system that regulates the circulating levels of vital glucocorticoid hormones. The activity of the HPA axis is characterized not only by a classic circadian rhythm, but also by an ultradian pattern of discrete pulsatile release of glucocorticoids. A number of psychiatric and metabolic diseases are associated with changes in glucocorticoid pulsatility, and it is now clear that glucocorticoid responsive genes respond to these rapid fluctuations in a biologically meaningful way. Theoretical modelling has enabled us to identify and explore potential mechanisms underlying the ultradian activity in this axis, which to date have not been identified successfully. We demonstrate that the combination of delay with feed-forward and feedback loops in the pituitary-adrenal system is sufficient to give rise to ultradian pulsatility in the absence of an ultradian source from a supra-pituitary site. Moreover, our model enables us to predict the different patterns of glucocorticoid release mediated by changes in hypophysial-portal corticotrophin-releasing hormone levels, with results that parallel our experimental in vivo data.},

	Abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium channels of the inner mitochondrial membrane (mtKATP) are blocked by ATP. They are suggested to be involved in protective mechanisms such as ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Here we identify this channel type for the first time in a human cell line (Jurkat cells). Vesicles of the inner mitochondrial membrane (mitoplasts) were prepared by hypoosmotic shock. Single-channel currents were measured by means of the patch-clamp technique. We identified an outward-rectifying channel with a slope conductance of 15 and 82 pS at negative and positive potentials, respectively. The block by 5-hydroxydecanoic acid and inhibition by ATP characterize this channel as the mtKATP channel. ATP also increased the frequency of events within the burst. This effect was modulated by the Ca2+-bath concentration. We also show that the human mtKATP channel is a direct target for nitric oxide that blocked the channel activity. Although the molecular structure of this channel type is still unknown, its characterization as an outward-rectifying channel and modulation by calcium ions and nitric oxide may help to elucidate its functional significance, which possibly implicates a role in cell survival after IPC.},

	Abstract = {A cell culture model of blood-brain barrier (BBB, coculture of rat brain endothelial cells with rat astrocytes) was used to investigate the effect of nitric oxide (.NO) on the damage of the BBB induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Permeability coefficient of fluorescein across the endothelium was used as a marker of BBB tightness. The permeability coefficient increased 5.2 times after H/R indicating strong disruption of the BBB. The presence of the .NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 30 microM), authentic .NO (6 microM) or superoxide dismutase (50 units/ml) during H/R attenuated H/R-induced increase in permeability. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM .NO did not influence the function of BBB during normoxia, however, severe disruption was observed using 150 microM of SNAP and more than 24 microM of .NO. After H/R of endothelial cells, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased 2.3 times indicating radical-induced peroxidation of membrane lipids. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM authentic .NO completely prevented MDA formation. The results show that .NO may effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species formed during H/R of brain capillary endothelial cells, affording protection of BBB at the molecular and functional level.},

	Abstract = {It is known that the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation possesses fast and slow travelling waves. Fast waves are perturbations of singular orbits consisting of two pieces of slow manifolds and connections between them, whereas slow waves are perturbations of homoclinic orbits of the unperturbed system. We unfold a degenerate point where the two types of singular orbits coalesce forming a heteroclinic orbit of the unperturbed system. Letcdenote the wave speed and[var epsilon]the singular perturbation parameter. We show that there exists aC2smooth curve of homoclinic orbits of the form (c, [var epsilon](c)) connecting the fast wave branch to the slow wave branch. Additionally we show that this curve has a unique non-degenerate maximum. Our analysis is based on a Shilnikov coordinates result, extending the Exchange Lemma of Jones and Kopell. We also prove the existence of inclination-flip points for the travelling wave equation thus providing the evidence of the existence ofn-homoclinic orbits (n-pulses for the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation) for arbitraryn.},

Evolutionary studies indicate that the emergence of higher cognitive functions in humans is associated with an increased glucose utilization and expression of energy metabolism genes. Functional brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and PET, which are widely used in human neuroscience studies, detect signals that monitor energy delivery and use in register with neuronal activity. Recent technological advances in metabolic studies with cellular resolution have afforded decisive insights into the understanding of the cellular and molecular bases of the coupling between neuronal activity and energy metabolism and pointat a key role of neuron-astrocyte metabolic interactions. This article reviews some of the most salient features emerging from recent studies and aims at providing an integration of brain energy metabolism across resolution scales.},

	Abstract = {Processing of neuronal information depends on interactions between the anatomical connectivity and cellular properties of single cells. We examined how these computational building blocks work together in the intact rat hippocampus. Single spikes in dentate granule cells, controlled intracellularly, generally failed to discharge either interneurons or CA3 pyramidal cells. In contrast, trains of spikes effectively discharged both CA3 cell types. Increasing the discharge rate of the granule cell increased the discharge probability of its target neuron and decreased the delay between the onset of a granule cell train and evoked firing in postsynaptic targets. Thus, we conclude that the granule cell to CA3 synapses are 'conditional detonators,' dependent on granule cell firing pattern. In addition, we suggest that information in single granule cells is converted into a temporal delay code in target CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons. These data demonstrate how a neural circuit of the CNS may process information.},

	Abstract = {The discovery that transient elevations of calcium concentration occur in astrocytes, and release 'gliotransmitters' which act on neurons and vascular smooth muscle, led to the idea that astrocytes are powerful regulators of neuronal spiking, synaptic plasticity and brain blood flow. These findings were challenged by a second wave of reports that astrocyte calcium transients did not mediate functions attributed to gliotransmitters and were too slow to generate blood flow increases. Remarkably, the tide has now turned again: the most important calcium transients occur in fine astrocyte processes not resolved in earlier studies, and new mechanisms have been discovered by which astrocyte [Ca(2+)]i is raised and exerts its effects. Here we review how this third wave of discoveries has changed our understanding of astrocyte calcium signaling and its consequences for neuronal function.},

	Abstract = {Neurovascular coupling provides the basis for many functional neuroimaging techniques. Nitric oxide (NO), adenosine, cyclooxygenase, CYP450 epoxygenase, and potassium are involved in dilating arterioles during neuronal activation. We combined inhibition of NO synthase, cyclooxygenase, adenosine receptors, CYP450 epoxygenase, and inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels to test whether these pathways could explain the blood flow response to neuronal activation. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) of the somatosensory cortex were measured during forepaw stimulation in 24 rats using a laser Doppler/spectroscopy probe through a cranial window. Combined inhibition reduced CBF responses by two-thirds, somatosensory evoked potentials and activation-induced CMRO(2) increases remained unchanged, and deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) response was abrogated. This shows that in the rat somatosensory cortex, one-third of the physiological blood flow increase is sufficient to prevent microcirculatory increase of deoxy-Hb concentration during neuronal activity. The large physiological CBF response is not necessary to support small changes in CMRO(2). We speculate that the CBF response safeguards substrate delivery during functional activation with a considerable 'safety factor'. Reduction of the CBF response in pathological states may abolish the BOLD-fMRI signal, without affecting underlying neuronal activity.},

Inadequate data in this area can lead to severe underestimation of the spatial specificity of the BOLD response. We took thick sections of Indian ink injected human brain and, using confocal laser microscopy and a novel three-dimensional computer-assisted method we extracted and analyzed hundreds of thousands of vascular segments within a large area of cortex. From this database the global densities, the statistical distributions of diameters and lengths were analysed, separating the tree-like and the net-like parts of the microcirculation. Furthermore, our analysis included variations in volume density along the cortical depth and along vectors parallel to the cortical surface. These morphometric parameters are all key requirements for a sound model of cerebral microcirculation. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {A major receptor for nitric oxide (NO) is the cGMP-synthesizing enzyme, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), but it is not known how this enzyme behaves in cells. In cerebellar cells, NO (from diethylamine NONOate) increased astrocytic cGMP with a potency (EC(50) {\textless}/= 20 nM) higher than that reported for purified sGC. Deactivation of NO-stimulated sGC activity, studied by trapping free NO with hemoglobin, took place within seconds (or less) rather than the minute time scale reported for the purified enzyme. Measurement of the rates of accumulation and degradation of cGMP were used to follow the activity of sGC over time. The peak activity, occurring within seconds of adding NO, was swiftly followed by desensitization to a steady-state level 8-fold lower. The same desensitizing profile was observed when the net sGC activity was increased or decreased or when cGMP breakdown was inhibited. Recovery from desensitization was relatively slow (half-time = 1.5 min). When the cells were lysed, sGC desensitization was lost. Analysis of the transient cGMP response to NO in human platelets showed that sGC underwent a similar desensitization. The results indicate that, in its natural environment, sGC behaves much more like a neurotransmitter receptor than had been expected from previous enzymological studies, and that hitherto unknown sGC regulatory factors exist. Rapid sGC desensitization, in concert with variations in the rate of cGMP breakdown, provides a fundamental mechanism for shaping cellular cGMP responses and is likely to be important in decoding NO signals under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but its manifestation during neuronal activation in the ex vivo hippocampus from TLE patients has not been shown. We characterized metabolic and mitochondrial functions in acute hippocampal slices from pilocarpine-treated, chronic epileptic rats and from pharmaco-resistant TLE patients. Recordings of NAD(P)H fluorescence indicated the status of cellular energy metabolism, and simultaneous monitoring of extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) allowed us to control the induction of neuronal activation. In control rats, electrical stimulation elicited biphasic NAD(P)H fluorescence transients that were characterized by a brief initial 'drop' and a subsequent prolonged 'overshoot' correlating to enhanced NAD(P)+ reduction. In chronic epileptic rats, overshoots were significantly smaller in area CA1, but not in the subiculum as compared to controls. In TLE patients, who were histopathologically classified in groups with and without Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS, non-AHS), large drops and very small overshoots of NAD(P)H transients were observed in dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1 and subiculum. Nevertheless, monitoring mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) by mitochondria-specific, voltage-sensitive dye (rhodamine-123) revealed similar mitochondrial responses during neuronal activation with glutamate and protonophore application in area CA1 of control and chronic-epileptic rats. Applying confocal laser scanning microscopy, these findings were confirmed in individual neurons of AHS tissue, indicating a negative DeltaPsi(m) and activation-dependent mitochondrial depolarization. Our data demonstrate severe metabolic dysfunction during neuronal activation in the hippocampus from chronic epileptic rats and humans, although mitochondria maintain negative DeltaPsi(m). Thus, our findings provide a cellular correlate for 'hypometabolism' as described for epilepsy patients and suggest mitochondrial enzyme defects in TLE.},

	Abstract = {Normal brain function requires proper supply of oxygen and glucose in a timely and local manner. This is achieved through an orchestrated intercellular communication between neurones, astrocytes and microvessels that results in a rapid and restricted increase in cerebral blood flow, a process known as neurovascular coupling. Astrocytic end-feet make close contacts with neuronal synapses and blood vessels and, given their ability to release vasoactive signals following neuronal activation, have been recognized as key intermediaries in the neurovascular response. Both dilating and constricting signals appear to be released from astrocytes upon increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and both dilatation and constriction of brain vessels have been observed in previous studies. In this article, we discuss the various astrocyte-derived vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals, their interactions and effects on astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and suggest the importance of the intrinsic properties of the latter cell type on the overall neurovascular response. We present a working model in which the rise in astrocytic Ca(2+) following neuronal activation leads not only to the rapid activation of calcium-activated K(+) channels in astrocytic end-feet, but also to their modulation by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway, which in general have been proposed to act on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than on astrocytes. We propose that this latter mechanism may in turn modulate K(+) signalling from astrocytes to smooth muscle cells, influencing the overall effects of the vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals released during neuronal activation.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the combined effect of increased brain topical K+ concentration and reduction of the nitric oxide (NO.) level caused by nitric oxide scavenging or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition on regional cerebral blood flow and subarachnoid direct current (DC) potential. Using thiopental-anesthetized male Wistar rats with a closed cranial window preparation, brain topical superfusion of a combination of the NO. scavenger hemoglobin (Hb; 2 mmol/L) and increased K+ concentration in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid ([K+]ACSF) at 35 mmol/L led to sudden spontaneous transient ischemic events with a decrease of CBF to 14+/-7{\%} (n=4) compared with the baseline (100{\%}). The ischemic events lasted for 53+/-17 minutes and were associated with a negative subarachnoid DC shift of -7.3+/-0.6 mV of 49+/-12 minutes' duration. The combination of the NOS inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 1 mmol/L) with [K+]ACSF at 35 mmol/L caused similar spontaneous transient ischemic events in 13 rats. When cortical spreading depression was induced by KCl at a 5-mm distance, a typical cortical spreading hyperemia (CSH) and negative DC shift were measured at the closed cranial window during brain topical superfusion with either physiologic artificial CSF (n=5), or artificial CSF containing increased [K+]ACSF at 20 mmol/L (n=4), [K+]ACSF at 3 mmol/L combined with L-NA (n=10), [K+]ACSF at 10 mmol/L combined with L-NA (five of six animals) or [K+]ACSF at 3 mmol/L combined with Hb (three of four animals). Cortical spreading depression induced longlasting transient ischemia instead of CSH, when brain was superfused with either [K+]ACSF at 20 mmol/L combined with Hb (CBF decrease to 20+/-20{\%} duration 25+/-21 minutes, n=4), or [K+]ACSF at 20 mmol/L combined with L-NA (n=19). Transient ischemia induced by NOS inhibition and [K],ACSF at 20 mmol/L propagated at a speed of 3.4+/-0.6 mm/min, indicating cortical spreading ischemia (CSI). Although CSH did not change oxygen free radical production, as measured on-line by in vivo lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, CSI resulted in the typical radical production pattern of ischemia and reperfusion suggestive of brain damage (n=4). Nimodipine (2 microg/kg body weight/min intravenously) transformed CSI back to CSH (n=4). Vehicle had no effect on CSI (n=4). Our data suggest that the combination of decreased NO. levels and increased subarachnoid K+ levels induces spreading depression with acute ischemic CBF response. Thus, a disturbed coupling of metabolism and CBF can cause ischemia. We speculate that CSI may be related to delayed ischemic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage, a clinical condition in which the release of Hb and K+ from erythrocytes creates a microenvironment similar to the one investigated here.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (*NO) is a diffusible intercellular messenger, acting via volume signaling in the brain and, therefore, the knowledge of its temporal dynamics is determinant to the understanding of its neurobiological role. However, such an analysis in vivo is challenging and indirect or static approaches are mostly used to infer *NO bioactivity. In the present work we measured the glutamate-dependent *NO temporal dynamics in vivo in the hippocampus (CA1, CA3 and DG subregions), cerebral cortex and striatum, using *NO selective microelectrodes. Concurrently, the immunolocalization of nNOS was evaluated in each region. A transitory increase in *NO levels occurred at higher amplitudes in the striatum and hippocampus relatively to the cortex. In the hippocampus, subtle differences in the profiles of *NO signals were observed along the trisynaptic loop, with CA1 exhibiting the largest signals. The topography of *NO temporal dynamics did not fully overlap with the pattern of the density of nNOS expression, suggesting that, complementary to the distribution of nNOS, the local regulation of *NO synthesis as well as the decay pathways critically determine the effective *NO concentration sensed by a target within the diffusional spread of this free radical. In sum, the rate and pattern of *NO changes here shown, by incorporating regulatory mechanisms and processes that affect *NO synthesis and decay, provide refined information critical for the understanding of *NO multiple actions in the brain. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Throughout the history of research on stroke pathophysiology, focus has shifted from purely vascular concepts to the insight that a complex interplay of biochemical and molecular mechanisms involving practically any cell type of the brain ("neurovascular unit") partakes in either salvage or demise of the tissue after a stroke. In addition, it was realized that peripheral immune cells play important roles, not only after their invasion into the brain but also because of stroke-induced effects on the immune system that can result in infections. Indeed, outcome of stroke patients is not only dictated by nonmodifiable factors, such as severity of stroke, age, or premorbidity, but also by modifiable factors largely related to medical complications, such as infections and possibly sarcopenia. The highly successful concept of stroke units attests to the benefits of treating stroke comprehensively. Breakthroughs in improving outcome after stroke will only result from approaches that target not only the brain, but also systemic effects of stroke.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a risk factor for dementia. It is unknown whether higher glucose levels increase the risk of dementia in people without diabetes.

METHODS: We used 35,264 clinical measurements of glucose levels and 10,208 measurements of glycated hemoglobin levels from 2067 participants without dementia to examine the relationship between glucose levels and the risk of dementia. Participants were from the Adult Changes in Thought study and included 839 men and 1228 women whose mean age at baseline was 76 years; 232 participants had diabetes, and 1835 did not. We fit Cox regression models, stratified according to diabetes status and adjusted for age, sex, study cohort, educational level, level of exercise, blood pressure, and status with respect to coronary and cerebrovascular diseases, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and treatment for hypertension.

RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, dementia developed in 524 participants (74 with diabetes and 450 without). Among participants without diabetes, higher average glucose levels within the preceding 5 years were related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.01); with a glucose level of 115 mg per deciliter (6.4 mmol per liter) as compared with 100 mg per deciliter (5.5 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio for dementia was 1.18 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.33). Among participants with diabetes, higher average glucose levels were also related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.002); with a glucose level of 190 mg per deciliter (10.5 mmol per liter) as compared with 160 mg per deciliter (8.9 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.40 (95{\%} CI, 1.12 to 1.76).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher glucose levels may be a risk factor for dementia, even among persons without diabetes. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)},

	Abstract = {In the vessel wall, endothelial cells are metabolically and electrically coupled to each other and to the adjacent smooth muscle cells by gap junctions composed of connexins. Gap junctions may be formed from combinations of several different connexin proteins, and deletion of one connexin can lead to modification of the expression of another. To reveal a possible interaction between connexin40 (Cx40) and connexin43 (Cx43) in endothelium, we studied their distribution in vessels from C57Bl/6 and Cx40 knockout mice (Cx40-/-) using immunoblots and immunocytochemistry on aortic cross sections and en face whole mounts. En face preparations from C57Bl/6 mice revealed two distinct pools of Cx43, one pericellular and the other intracellular. Cx40 was largely restricted to the periphery of the cells, and in Cx40-/- mice it was, as expected, undetectable. In the Cx40-/- mice, total Cx43 protein was also modestly reduced (immunoblots), but there was a major redistribution of the protein within the cell. The pericellular component of Cx43 was rendered virtually undetectable, and the intracellular compartments were normal or even slightly elevated. Smooth muscle Cx43 was also reduced in the Cx40-/- animals. These findings indicate that the cellular distribution of Cx43 is dependent on the presence of Cx40, and in view of the profound effects on the pericellular pool of the Cx43, the findings suggest that interactions between Cx40 and Cx43 regulate communication between endothelial cells and perhaps between smooth muscle and endothelial cells as well.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide synthases (NOS) are the enzymes responsible for nitric oxide (NO) generation. NO is a free radical which reacts with various molecules to cause multiple biological effects. It is clear that the generation and actions of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions are exquisitely regulated and extend to almost every cell type and function within the circulation. While the molecule mediates many physiological functions, an excessive presence of NO is toxic to cells. The enzyme NOS, constitutively or inductively, catalyses the production of NO in several biological systems. NO is derived not only from NOS isoforms but also from NOS-independent sources. In mammals, to date, three distinct NOS isoforms have been identified: neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS). The molecular structure, enzymology and pharmacology of these enzymes have been well defined, and reveal critical roles for the NOS system in a variety of important physiological processes. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the interactions between NOS enzymes and pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the role of NO agonists as potential therapeutic agents in treatment of CVD},

To address this issue, we compared the fits of four plausible models of neurometabolic coupling dynamics to available data for simultaneous recordings of the local field potential (LFP) and the local BOLD response recorded from monkey primary visual cortex over a wide range of stimulus durations. The four models of the metabolic demand driving the BOLD response were: direct coupling with the overall LFP; rectified coupling to the LFP; coupling with a slow adaptive component of the implied neural population response; and coupling with the non-adaptive intracellular input signal defined by the stimulus time course. Taking all stimulus durations into account, the results imply that the BOLD response is most closely coupled with metabolic demand derived from the intracellular input waveform, without significant influence from the adaptive transients and nonlinearities exhibited by the LFP waveform.},

	Abstract = {The cerebrovascular regulation involves highly complex mechanisms to assure that the brain is perfused at all times. These mechanisms depend on all components of the neurovascular units: neurons, glia, and vascular cells. All these cell types can produce nitric oxide (NO), a powerful vasodilator through different NO synthases. Many studies underlined the key role of NO in the maintenance of resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as in the mechanisms that control cerebrovascular tone: autoregulation and neurovascular coupling. However, although the role of NO in the control of CBF has been largely investigated, the complexity of the NO system and the lack of specific NO synthase inhibitors led to still unresolved questions such as the origin of NO and the pathways by which it controls the vascular tone. In this chapter, the role of NO in the regulation of CBF is critically reviewed and discussed in the context of the neurovascular unit and the general principles of cerebrovascular regulation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes play a critical role in neurovascular coupling by providing a physical linkage from synapses to arterioles and releasing vaso-active gliotransmitters. We identified a gliotransmitter pathway by which astrocytes influence arteriole lumen diameter. Astrocytes synthesize and release NMDA receptor coagonist, D-serine, in response to neurotransmitter input. Mouse cortical slice astrocyte activation by metabotropic glutamate receptors or photolysis of caged Ca(2+) produced dilation of penetrating arterioles in a manner attenuated by scavenging D-serine with D-amino acid oxidase, deleting the enzyme responsible for D-serine synthesis (serine racemase) or blocking NMDA receptor glycine coagonist sites with 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid. We also found that dilatory responses were dramatically reduced by inhibition or elimination of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and that the vasodilatory effect of endothelial nitric oxide synthase is likely mediated by suppressing levels of the vasoconstrictor arachidonic acid metabolite, 20-hydroxy arachidonic acid. Our results provide evidence that D-serine coactivation of NMDA receptors and endothelial nitric oxide synthase is involved in astrocyte-mediated neurovascular coupling.},

It is the crucial difference between isolated cells and intact tissue. Cells communicate in various ways with each other; these include the release of chemical transmitters, hormones and mediators as well as direct electrical and chemical intercellular communication via gap junction channels. The gap junction coupling is important for the organization of the tissue as an electrical syncytium and for accurate development. Pharmacological modulation of these channels could be important in the fields of arrhythmogenesis, vasomotion and cell differentiation. In this review, Stefan Dhein outlines the structure, synthesis and function of gap junction channels. Since their physiology and pharmacology are best investigated in the cardiovascular system, the second part of the article focuses on the role of gap junctions in the heart and vasculature, with special emphasis on the regulation of the channels by physiological stimuli such as ions, pH mediators and transjunctional voltage as well as their pharmacological modulation.},

	Abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"--the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15{\%} arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling.},

@article{Simon2015a,
	Abstract = {Calibrated BOLD imaging, in which traditional measurements of the BOLD signal are combined with measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) within a BOLD biophysical model to estimate changes in oxygen metabolism (CMRO2), has been a valuable tool for untangling the physiological processes associated with neural stimulus-induced BOLD activation. However, to date this technique has largely been applied to the study of essentially steady-state physiological changes (baseline to activation) associated with block-design stimuli, and it is unclear whether this approach may be directly extended to the study of more dynamic, naturalistic experimental designs. In this study we tested an assumption underlying this technique whose validity is critical to the application of calibrated BOLD to the study of more dynamic stimuli, that information about fluctuations in venous cerebral blood volume (CBVv) can be captured indirectly by measuring fluctuations in CBF, making the independent measurement of CBVv unnecessary. To accomplish this, simultaneous arterial spin labeling and BOLD imaging were used to measure the CBF and BOLD responses to flickering checkerboards with contrasts that oscillated continuously with frequencies of {\~{}}0.02-0.16Hz. The measurements were then fit to a dynamic physiological model of the BOLD response in order to explore the range of consistent CMRO2 and CBVv responses. We found that the BOLD and CBF responses were most consistent with relatively tight dynamic coupling between CBF and CMRO2 and a CBVv response that was an order of magnitude slower than either CBF or CMRO2. This finding suggests that the assumption of tight flow-volume coupling may not be strictly valid, complicating the extension of calibrated BOLD to more naturalistic experimental designs.},

@article{Hakim1999,
	Abstract = {In a weakly excitable medium, characterized by a large threshold stimulus, the free end of an isolated broken plane wave (wave tip) can either rotate (steadily or unsteadily) around a large excitable core, thereby producing a spiral pattern, or retract, causing the wave to vanish at boundaries. An asymptotic analysis of spiral motion and retraction is carried out in this weakly excitable large core regime starting from the free-boundary limit of the reaction-diffusion models, valid when the excited region is delimited by a thin interface. The wave description is shown to naturally split between the tip region and a far region that are smoothly matched on an intermediate scale. This separation allows us to rigorously derive an equation of motion for the wave tip, with the large scale motion of the spiral wave front slaved to the tip. This kinematic description provides both a physical picture and exact predictions for a wide range of wave behavior, including (i) steady rotation (frequency and core radius), (ii) exact treatment of the meandering instability in the free-boundary limit with the prediction that the frequency of unstable motion is half the primary steady frequency, (iii) drift under external actions (external field with application to axisymmetric scroll ring motion in three dimensions, and spatial- or/and time-dependent variation of excitability), and (iv) the dynamics of multiarmed spiral waves with the prediction that steadily rotating waves with two or more arms are linearly unstable. Numerical simulations of FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics are used to test several aspects of our results. In addition, we discuss the semiquantitative extension of this theory to finite cores and pinpoint mathematical subtleties related to the thin interface limit of singly diffusive reaction-diffusion models.},

@article{Shetty2012,
	Abstract = {Neuronal activity, astrocytic responses to this activity, and energy homeostasis are linked together during baseline, conscious conditions, and short-term rapid activation (as occurs with sensory or motor function). Nervous system energy homeostasis also varies during long-term physiological conditions (i.e., development and aging) and with adaptation to pathological conditions, such as ischemia or low glucose. Neuronal activation requires increased metabolism (i.e., ATP generation) which leads initially to substrate depletion, induction of a variety of signals for enhanced astrocytic function, and increased local blood flow and substrate delivery. Energy generation (particularly in mitochondria) and use during ATP hydrolysis also lead to considerable heat generation. The local increases in blood flow noted following neuronal activation can both enhance local substrate delivery but also provides a heat sink to help cool the brain and removal of waste by-products. In this review we highlight the interactions between short-term neuronal activity and energy metabolism with an emphasis on signals and factors regulating astrocyte function and substrate supply.},

Systemical (10 mg/kg) as well as topical (10-3 M) application of L-NA reduced the response to stimulation by approximately 50{\%}.

	Abstract = {Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is coupled to neuronal activity and is imaged in vivo to map brain activation. CBF is also modified by afferent projection fibres that release vasoactive neurotransmitters in the perivascular region, principally on the astrocyte endfeet that outline cerebral blood vessels. However, the role of astrocytes in the regulation of cerebrovascular tone remains uncertain. Here we determine the impact of intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in astrocytes on the diameter of small arterioles by using two-photon Ca(2+) uncaging to increase [Ca(2+)](i). Vascular constrictions occurred when Ca(2+) waves evoked by uncaging propagated into the astrocyte endfeet and caused large increases in [Ca(2+)](i). The vasoactive neurotransmitter noradrenaline increased [Ca(2+)](i) in the astrocyte endfeet, the peak of which preceded the onset of arteriole constriction. Depressing increases in astrocyte [Ca(2+)](i) with BAPTA inhibited the vascular constrictions in noradrenaline. We find that constrictions induced in the cerebrovasculature by increased [Ca(2+)](i) in astrocyte endfeet are generated through the phospholipase A(2)-arachidonic acid pathway and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production. Vasoconstriction by astrocytes is a previously unknown mechanism for the regulation of CBF.},

Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy was used to measure spontaneous and sensory evoked changes in flow and volume at the level of single vessels. We find that arterioles exhibit slow ({\textless}1 Hz) spontaneous increases in their diameter, as well as pronounced dilation in response to both punctate and prolonged stimulation of the contralateral vibrissae. In contrast, venules dilate only in response to prolonged stimulation. We conclude that stimulation that occurs on the time scale of natural stimuli leads to a net increase in the reservoir of arteriole blood.

@article{Beckman1996,
	Abstract = {Nitric oxide contrasts with most intercellular messengers because it diffuses rapidly and isotropically through most tissues with little reaction but cannot be transported through the vasculature due to rapid destruction by oxyhemoglobin. The rapid diffusion of nitric oxide between cells allows it to locally integrate the responses of blood vessels to turbulence, modulate synaptic plasticity in neurons, and control the oscillatory behavior of neuronal networks. Nitric oxide is not necessarily short lived and is intrinsically no more reactive than oxygen. The reactivity of nitric oxide per se has been greatly overestimated in vitro because no drain is provided to remove nitric oxide. Nitric oxide persists in solution for several minutes in micromolar concentrations before it reacts with oxygen to form much stronger oxidants like nitrogen dioxide. Nitric oxide is removed within seconds in vivo by diffusion over 100 microns through tissues to enter red blood cells and react with oxyhemoglobin. The direct toxicity of nitric oxide is modest but is greatly enhanced by reacting with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Nitric oxide is the only biological molecule produced in high enough concentrations to out-compete superoxide dismutase for superoxide. Peroxynitrite reacts relatively slowly with most biological molecules, making peroxynitrite a selective oxidant. Peroxynitrite modifies tyrosine in proteins to create nitrotyrosines, leaving a footprint detectable in vivo. Nitration of structural proteins, including neurofilaments and actin, can disrupt filament assembly with major pathological consequences. Antibodies to nitrotyrosine have revealed nitration in human atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, septic and distressed lung, inflammatory bowel disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with progressive cognitive deficits being the primary symptom. AD is neuropathologically characterized by amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle depositions, basal forebrain cholinergic deficit, and extensive neuronal loss and synaptic changes in the cortex and hippocampus. Mutations of amyloid precursor protein or presenilin genes or apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism appear to affect amyloid formation, which in turn causes neuronal death via a number of possible mechanisms, including Ca2+ homeostasis disruption, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, energy depletion, neuro-inflammation and apoptosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is an enzymatic product of nitric oxide synthase, which exists in three isoforms. In addition to its vasoactive and immunological properties, NO has significant neurophysiological functions. However, NO can also be neurotoxic primarily due to its free radical properties, and it has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that NO may have a role in the aforementioned AD pathogenetic mechanisms, and putative links between NO and AD are beginning to be recognized. This review focuses on these issues highlighting the possible relevance of NO in AD, either as a neuroprotective or neurotoxic agent. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies reveal a novel role for hemoglobin as an allosterically regulated nitrite reductase that may mediate nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signaling along the physiological oxygen gradient. Nitrite reacts with deoxyhemoglobin in an allosteric reaction that generates NO and oxidizes deoxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. NO then reacts at a nearly diffusion-limited rate with deoxyhemoglobin to form iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, which to date has been considered a highly stable adduct and, thus, not a source of bioavailable NO. However, under physiological conditions of partial oxygen saturation, nitrite will also react with oxyhemoglobin, and although this complex autocatalytic reaction has been studied for a century, the interaction of the oxy- and deoxy-reactions and the effects on NO disposition have never been explored. We have now characterized the kinetics of hemoglobin oxidation and NO generation at a range of oxygen partial pressures and found that the deoxy-reaction runs in parallel with and partially inhibits the oxy-reaction. In fact, intermediates in the oxy-reaction oxidize the heme iron of iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, a product of the deoxy-reaction, which releases NO from the iron-nitrosyl. This oxidative denitrosylation is particularly striking during cycles of hemoglobin deoxygenation and oxygenation in the presence of nitrite. These chemistries may contribute to the oxygen-dependent disposition of nitrite in red cells by limiting oxidative inactivation of nitrite by oxyhemoglobin, promoting nitrite reduction to NO by deoxyhemoglobin, and releasing free NO from iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin.},

	Abstract = {SUNDIALS is a suite of advanced computational codes for solving large-scale problems that can be modeled as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, or as initial-value problems in ordinary differential or differential-algebraic equations. The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suitable for either serial or parallel machine environments. Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.},

	Abstract = {Despite striking advances in functional brain imaging, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the signals detected by these techniques are still largely unknown. The basic physiological principle of functional imaging is represented by the tight coupling existing between neuronal activity and the associated local increase in both blood flow and energy metabolism. Positron emission tomography (PET) signals detect blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose use associated with neuronal activity; the degree of blood oxygenation is currently thought to contribute to the signal detected with functional magnetic resonance imaging, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) identifies the spatio-temporal pattern of the activity-dependent appearance of certain metabolic intermediates such as glucose or lactate. Recent studies, including those of neurotransmitter-regulated metabolic fluxes in purified preparations and analyses of the cellular localization of enzymes and transporters involved in energy metabolism, as well as in vivo microdialysis and MRS approaches have identified the neurotransmitter glutamate and astrocytes, a specific type of glial cell, as pivotal elements in the coupling of synaptic activity with energy metabolism. Astrocytes are ideally positioned to sense increases in synaptic activity and to couple them with energy metabolism. Indeed they possess specialized processes that cover the surface of intraparenchymal capillaries, suggesting that astrocytes may be a likely site of prevalent glucose uptake. Other astrocyte processes are wrapped around synaptic contacts which possess receptors and reuptake sites for neurotransmitters. Glutamate stimulates glucose uptake into astrocytes. This effect is mediated by specific glutamate transporters present on these cells. The activity of these transporters, which is tightly coupled to the synaptic release of glutamate and operates the clearance of glutamate from the extracellular space, is driven by the electrochemical gradient of Na+. This Na(+)-dependent uptake of glutamate into astrocytes triggers a cascade of molecular events involving the Na+/K(+)-ATPase leading to the glycolytic processing of glucose and the release of lactate by astrocytes. The stoichiometry of this process is such that for one glutamate molecule taken up with three Na+ ions, one glucose molecule enters an astrocyte, two ATP molecules are produced through aerobic glycolysis and two lactate molecules are released. Within the astrocyte, one ATP molecule fuels one 'turn of the pump' while the other provides the energy needed to convert glutamate to glutamine by glutamine synthase. Evidence has been accumulated from structural as well as functional studies indicating that, under aerobic conditions, lactate may be the preferred energy substrate of activated neurons. Indeed, in the presence of oxygen, lactate is converted to pyruvate, which can be processed through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the associated oxidative phosphorylation, to yield 17 ATP molecules per lactate molecule. These data suggest that during activation the brain may transiently resort to aerobic glycolysis occurring in astrocytes, followed by the oxidation of lactate by neurons. The proposed model provides a direct mechanism to couple synaptic activity with glucose use and is consistent with the notion that the signals detected during physiological activation with 18F-deoxyglucose (DG)-PET may reflect predominantly uptake of the tracer into astrocytes. This conclusion does not question the validity of the 2-DG-based techniques, rather it provides a cellular and molecular basis for these functional brain imaging techniques.},

	Abstract = {The inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit Kir5.1 is expressed abundantly in the brain, but its precise distribution and function are still largely unknown. Because Kir5.1 is co-expressed with Kir4.1 in retinal glial Muller cells, we have compared the biochemical and immunological properties of Kir5.1 and Kir4.1 in the mouse brain. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that brain expressed at least two subsets of Kir channels, heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1. Immunolabeling using specific antibodies showed that channels comprising Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 subunits were assembled in a region-specific fashion. Heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 was identified in the neocortex and in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Homomeric Kir4.1 was confined to the hippocampus and the thalamus. Homomeric Kir5.1 was not identified. Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 expression appeared to occur only in astrocytes, specifically in the membrane domains facing the pia mater and blood vessels or in the processes surrounding synapses. Both Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 could be associated with PDZ domain-containing syntrophins, which might be involved in the subcellular targeting of these astrocyte Kir channels. Because heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1 have distinct ion channel properties (Tanemoto, M., Kittaka, N., Inanobe, A., and Kurachi, Y. (2000) J. Physiol.

	Abstract = {Under the approximation that blood behaves as a continuum, a numerical implementation is presented to analyze the linear stability of capillary blood flow through model tree and honeycomb networks that are based on the microvascular structures of biological tissues. The tree network is comprised of a cascade of diverging bifurcations, in which a parent vessel bifurcates into two descendent vessels, while the honeycomb network also contains converging bifurcations, in which two parent vessels merge into one descendent vessel. At diverging bifurcations, a cell partitioning law is required to account for the nonuniform distribution of red blood cells as a function of the flow rate of blood into each descendent vessel. A linearization of the governing equations produces a system of delay differential equations involving the discharge hematocrit entering each network vessel and leads to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. All eigenvalues in a specified region of the complex plane are captured using a transformation based on contour integrals to construct a linear eigenvalue problem with identical eigenvalues, which are then determined using a standard QR algorithm. The predicted value of the dimensionless exponent in the cell partitioning law at the instability threshold corresponds to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in numerical simulations of the equations governing unsteady blood flow. Excellent agreement is found between the predictions of the linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations. The relaxation of the assumption of plug flow made in previous stability analyses typically has a small, quantitative effect on the stability results that depends on the specific network structure. This implementation of the stability analysis can be applied to large networks with arbitrary structure provided only that the connectivity among the network segments is known.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) is responsible for the vascular smooth muscle relaxation elicited by endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). EDRF is an unstable humoral substance released from artery and vein that mediates the action of endothelium-dependent vasodilators. NO is an unstable endothelium-independent vasodilator that is released from vasodilator drugs such as nitroprusside and glyceryl trinitrate. We have repeatedly observed that the actions of NO on vascular smooth muscle closely resemble those of EDRF. In the present study the vascular effects of EDRF released from perfused bovine intrapulmonary artery and vein were compared with the effects of NO delivered by superfusion over endothelium-denuded arterial and venous strips arranged in a cascade. EDRF was indistinguishable from NO in that both were labile (t1/2 = 3-5 sec), inactivated by pyrogallol or superoxide anion, stabilized by superoxide dismutase, and inhibited by oxyhemoglobin or potassium. Both EDRF and NO produced comparable increases in cyclic GMP accumulation in artery and vein, and this cyclic GMP accumulation was inhibited by pyrogallol, oxyhemoglobin, potassium, and methylene blue. EDRF was identified chemically as NO, or a labile nitroso species, by two procedures. First, like NO, EDRF released from freshly isolated aortic endothelial cells reacted with hemoglobin to yield nitrosylhemoglobin. Second, EDRF and NO each similarly promoted the diazotization of sulfanilic acid and yielded the same reaction product after coupling with N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine. Thus, EDRF released from artery and vein possesses identical biological and chemical properties as NO.},

	Abstract = {Exposed to a sufficiently high extracellular potassium concentration ([K( + )]₀), the neuron can fire spontaneous discharges or even become inactivated due to membrane depolarisation ('depolarisation block'). Since these phenomena likely are related to the maintenance and propagation of seizure discharges, it is of considerable importance to understand the conditions under which excess [K( + )]₀ causes them. To address the putative effect of glial buffering on neuronal activity under elevated [K( + )](o) conditions, we combined a recently developed dynamical model of glial membrane ion and water transport with a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron model. In this interconnected glia-neuron model we investigated the effects of natural heterogeneity or pathological changes in glial membrane transporter density by considering a large set of models with different, yet empirically plausible, sets of model parameters. We observed both the high [K( + )]₀-induced duration of spontaneous neuronal firing and the prevalence of depolarisation block to increase when reducing the magnitudes of the glial transport mechanisms. Further, in some parameter regions an oscillatory bursting spiking pattern due to the dynamical coupling of neurons and glia was observed. Bifurcation analyses of the neuron model and of a simplified version of the neuron-glia model revealed further insights about the underlying mechanism behind these phenomena. The above insights emphasise the importance of combining neuron models with detailed astroglial models when addressing phenomena suspected to be influenced by the astroglia-neuron interaction. To facilitate the use of our neuron-glia model, a CellML version of it is made publicly available.},

	Abstract = {Modern neuroimaging techniques rely on neurovascular coupling to show regions of increased brain activation. However, little is known of the neurovascular coupling relationships that exist for inhibitory signals. To address this issue directly we developed a preparation to investigate the signal sources of one of these proposed inhibitory neurovascular signals, the negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (NBR), in rat somatosensory cortex. We found a reliable NBR measured in rat somatosensory cortex in response to unilateral electrical whisker stimulation, which was located in deeper cortical layers relative to the positive BOLD response. Separate optical measurements (two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry) revealed that the NBR was a result of decreased blood volume and flow and increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin. Neural activity in the NBR region, measured by multichannel electrodes, varied considerably as a function of cortical depth. There was a decrease in neuronal activity in deep cortical laminae. After cessation of whisker stimulation there was a large increase in neural activity above baseline. Both the decrease in neuronal activity and increase above baseline after stimulation cessation correlated well with the simultaneous measurement of blood flow suggesting that the NBR is related to decreases in neural activity in deep cortical layers. Interestingly, the magnitude of the neural decrease was largest in regions showing stimulus-evoked positive BOLD responses. Since a similar type of neural suppression in surround regions was associated with a negative BOLD signal, the increased levels of suppression in positive BOLD regions could importantly moderate the size of the observed BOLD response.},

	Abstract = {The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a critical unsolved question; and although recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between altered brain immune responses and disease progression, the mechanistic cause of neuronal dysfunction and death is unknown. We have previously described the unique CVN-AD mouse model of AD, in which immune-mediated nitric oxide is lowered to mimic human levels, resulting in a mouse model that demonstrates the cardinal features of AD, including amyloid deposition, hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau, behavioral changes, and age-dependent hippocampal neuronal loss. Using this mouse model, we studied longitudinal changes in brain immunity in relation to neuronal loss and, contrary to the predominant view that AD pathology is driven by proinflammatory factors, we find that the pathology in CVN-AD mice is driven by local immune suppression. Areas of hippocampal neuronal death are associated with the presence of immunosuppressive CD11c microglia and extracellular arginase, resulting in arginine catabolism and reduced levels of total brain arginine. Pharmacologic disruption of the arginine utilization pathway by an inhibitor of arginase and ornithine decarboxylase protected the mice from AD-like pathology and significantly decreased CD11c expression. Our findings strongly implicate local immune-mediated amino acid catabolism as a novel and potentially critical mechanism mediating the age-dependent and regional loss of neurons in humans with AD.},

	Abstract = {The amyloid {\$}\beta{\$}-peptide (A{\$}\beta{\$}) that accumulates as insoluble plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's victims can be neurotoxic, by a mechanism that may involve generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and destabilization of cellular calcium homeostasis. We now provide evidence that the mechanism of neurotoxicity of two other amyloidogenic peptides (APs), human amylin and {\$}\beta{\$}2-microglobulin, also involves induction of ROS and elevation of [Ca2+]i. Human amylin, {\$}\beta{\$}2-microglobulin and A{\$}\beta{\$}1-40 all caused significant death of neurons in rat hippocampal cell cultures during 24-48h exposure periods. Rat amylin, a non-AP, was not neurotoxic. Each AP caused an elevation of rest [Ca2+]i during a 20 h exposure period, and promoted a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i following exposure to glutamate which was significantly greater than controls. Each AP induced accumulation of ROS in neurons which preceded elevation of [Ca2+]i. Several antioxidants, including propyl gallate, vitamin E and the spin-trapping compound N-tert-butyl-{\$}\alpha{\$}-phenylnitrone attenuated the elevation of [Ca2+]i and neurotoxicity induced by the peptides. The data indicate that different APs share a common mechanism of neurotoxicity involving free radical accumulation and destabilization of [Ca2+]i homeostasis. {\textcopyright}1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Both hypertension and hypotension affect brain perfusion and worsen cognitive outcomes. The presence of hypertension and other vascular risk factors has been associated with decreased performance in executive function and attention tests. Cerebrovascular reserve has emerged as a potential biomarker for monitoring pressure-perfusion-cognition relationships. A decline in vascular reserve capacity can lead to impaired neurovascular coupling and decreased cognitive ability. Endothelial dysfunction, microvascular disease, and mascrovascular disease in midlife could also have an important role in the manifestations and severity of multiple medical conditions underlying cognitive decline late in life. However, questions remain about the role of antihypertensive therapies for long-term prevention of cognitive decline. In this Review, we address the underlying pathophysiology and the existing evidence supporting the role of vascular factors in late-life cognitive decline.},

	Abstract = {Optical imaging spectroscopy (OIS) and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) data sequences from anesthetized rats were used to determine the relationship between changes in oxy-and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration and changes in blood volume and flow in the presence and absence of stimulation. The data from Jones et al. (accompanying paper) were used to explore the differences between two theoretical models of flow activation coupling. The essential difference between the two models is the extension of the model of Buxton and Frank by Hyder et al. (1998, J. Appl. Physiol. 85: 554--564) to incorporate change in capillary diffusivity coupled to flow. In both models activation-increased flow changes increase oxygen transport from the capillary; however, in Hyder et al.'s model the diffusivity of the capillary itself is increased. Hyder et al. proposed a parameter (Omega), a scaling "constant" linking increased blood flow and oxygen "diffusivity" in the capillary bed. Thus, in Buxton and Frank's theory, Omega = 0; i.e., there are no changes in diffusivity. In Hyder et al.'s theory, 0 {\textless}Omega {\textless}1, and changes in diffusivity are assumed to be linearly related to flow changes. We elaborate the theoretical position of both models to show that, in principle, the different predictions from the two theories can be evaluated using optical imaging spectroscopy data. We find that both theoretical positions have limitations when applied to data from brief stimulation and when applied to data from mild hypercapnia. In summary, the analysis showed that although Hyder et al.'s proposal that diffusivity increased during activation did occur; it was shown to arise from an implementation of Buxton and Frank's theory under episodes of brief stimulation. The results also showed that the scaling parameter Omega is not a constant as the Hyder et al. model entails but in fact varies over the time course of the flow changes. Data from experiments in which mild hypercapnia was administered also indicated changes in the diffusivity of the capillary bed, but in this case the changes were negative; i.e., oxygen transport from the capillary decreased relative to baseline under hypercapnia. Neither of the models could account for the differences between the hypercapnia and activation data when matched for equivalent flow changes. A modification to the models to allow non-null tissue oxygen concentrations that can be moderated by changes due to increased metabolic demand following increased neural activity is proposed. This modification would allow modulation of oxygen transport from the capillary bed (e.g., changes in diffusivity) by tissue oxygen tension and would allow a degree of decoupling of flow and oxygen delivery, which can encompass both the data from stimulation and from hypercapnia.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical account is given of the processes governing the time courses of calcium ions (Ca2+), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in single cells following the application of external agonist to metabotropic receptors. A model is constructed that incorporates the regulation of metabotropic receptor activity, the G-protein cascade and the Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol. It is subsequently used to reproduce observations on the extent of desensitization and sequestration of the P2Y2 receptor following its activation by uridine triphosphate (UTP). The theory predicts the dependence on agonist concentration of the change in the number of receptors in the membrane as well as the time course of disappearance of receptors from the plasmalemma, upon exposure to agonist. In addition, the extent of activation and desensitization of the receptor, using the calcium transients in cells initiated by exposure to agonist, is also predicted. Model predictions show the significance of membrane PIP2 depletion and resupply on the time course of IP3 and Ca2+ levels. Results of the modelling also reveal the importance of receptor recycling and PIP2 resupply for maintaining Ca2+ and IP3 levels during sustained application of agonist. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	Abstract = {Intercellular propagation of a diffusible substance through direct cytoplasmic communication between multiple cells could represent an important mechanism for mutual multiple cell signaling between cells in a tissue. The current study was aimed at characterizing the mechanism(s) underlying the intercellular propagation of calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients between colonic smooth muscle cells. Changes in [Ca2+]i in smooth muscle cells from the rabbit distal colon in primary cultures were monitored using videomicroscopy with the fluorescent dye Fura-2. Myocytes responded to light mechanical deformation of the plasma membrane with a localized increase in [Ca2+]i which spread in a wave-like fashion through up to 5 adjacent cells, with little change in wave amplitude. Dye coupling between cells was demonstrated by Lucifer Yellow, and intercellular wave propagation was abolished by octanol, suggesting propagation of Ca2+ waves via gap junctions. Wave propagation was not dependent on extracellular [Ca2+]i suggesting regenerative release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Propagation of Ca2+ waves through silent cells suggested a diffusible messenger other than Ca2+. Wave propagation and kinetics were unaffected by ryanodine (50 microM) or caffeine (10 mM), but abolished by depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores and by the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 (10 microM), implicating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-sensitive stores as the major Ca2+ source for propagated Ca2+ transients. These results indicate that, in a connected complex of colonic smooth muscle cells in culture, multiple cells can monitor the mechanical status of a single cell through diffusion of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ca2+, or another intercellular messenger.},

	Abstract = {The major pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid plaques composed primarily of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, degenerating neurons and neurofibrillary tangles, and the presence of numerous activated astrocytes and microglia. Although extensive genetic data implicate Abeta in the neurodegenerative cascade of AD, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects on neurons and glia and the relationship between glial activation and neuronal death are not well defined. Abeta has been shown to induce glial activation, and a growing body of evidence suggests that activated glia contribute to neurotoxicity through generation of inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic free radicals, such as nitric oxide (NO), potent sources of oxidative stress known to occur in AD. It is therefore crucial to identify specific Abeta-induced molecular pathways mediating these responses in activated glia. We report that Abeta stimulates the activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB in rat astrocytes, that NFkappaB activation occurs selectively from p65 transactivation domain 2, and that Abeta-induced NO synthase expression and NO production occur through an NFkappaB-dependent mechanism. This demonstration of how Abeta couples an intracellular signal transduction pathway involving NFkappaB to a potentially neurotoxic response provides a key mechanistic link between Abeta and the generation of oxidative damage. Our results also suggest possible molecular targets upon which to focus future drug discovery efforts for AD.},

Due to strong a priori hypothesis, all fMRI correlation analyses were restricted to the following: (1) the frontal oculomotor cortex identified by the means of a prosaccadic task, comprising frontal eye fields and supplementary frontal eye fields; and (2) the data collected during inhibition of return, a phenomenon occurring during the executed task. In preHD, multiple regression analysis was performed between fMRI data and the probability to develop the disease in the next 5 years (p5HD).

@article{Dormanns2015,
	Abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K+ and the smooth muscle cell Ca2+ pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca2+ in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca2+ can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K+ SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca2+ is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca2+ in NVC, however this Ca2+ pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Every stimulus or task activates multiple areas in the mammalian cortex. These distributed activations can be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which has the best spatial resolution among the noninvasive brain imaging methods. Unfortunately, the relationship between the fMRI activations and distributed cortical processing has remained unclear, both because the coupling between neural and fMRI activations has remained poorly understood and because fMRI voxels are too large to directly sense the local neural events. To get an idea of the local processing given the macroscopic data, we need models to simulate the neural activity and to provide output that can be compared with fMRI data. Such models can describe neural mechanisms as mathematical functions between input and output in a specific system, with little correspondence to physiological mechanisms. Alternatively, models can be biomimetic, including biological details with straightforward correspondence to experimental data. After careful balancing between complexity, computational efficiency, and realism, a biomimetic simulation should be able to provide insight into how biological structures or functions contribute to actual data processing as well as to promote theory-driven neuroscience experiments. This review analyzes the requirements for validating system-level computational models with fMRI. In particular, we study mesoscopic biomimetic models, which include a limited set of details from real-life networks and enable system-level simulations of neural mass action. In addition, we discuss how recent developments in neurophysiology and biophysics may significantly advance the modelling of fMRI signals.},

	Abstract = {Gap junction channels provide an enclosed conduit for direct exchanges of signalling molecules, including ions and small metabolites between cells. This system of communication allows cells to monitor the functional state of their neighbours, and is rapidly modulated to continuously adapt to the immediate needs of groups of coupled cells. In the major arteries, endothelial cells may express three connexins isotypes, namely Connexin 37 (Cx37), Cx40 and Cx43, whereas the underlying smooth muscle cells may express Cx37, Cx40, Cx43 and Cx45. Moreover, myoendothelial gap junctions have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of vascular tone. This review highlights the regulation of vessel connexins in response to injury, as observed during experimental hypertension or wound repair, as well as the consequences of loss of one connexin in different transgenic null mice. In view of the major endocrine role of the kidney in the control of blood pressure, we also discuss the distribution of connexins in the kidney vasculature. Cx40 is present between endothelial cells of vessels and glomeruli, as well as between renin-secreting cells, the modified smooth muscle cells which form the wall of the terminal part of afferent arterioles. Modulation of Cx40 expression in a model of renin-dependent hypertension suggests that this connexin may be implicated in the function of renin-secreting cells. Finally, to address the possible regulation of connexin expression by fluid pressure, we summarize the effects of elevated transmural urine pressure on bladder Cx43 expression.},

	Abstract = {Using whole-cell patch-clamp technique and Fura-2 fluorescence measurement, the presence of ATP-activated ion channels and its dependence on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) in the epithelial cells of the endolymphatic sac were investigated. In zero current-clamp configuration, the average resting membrane potential was -66.8??1.3 mV (n=18). Application of 30 ??M ATP to the bath induced a rapid membrane depolarization by 43.1??2.4 mV (n=18). In voltage-clamp configuration, ATP-induced inward current at holding potential (V(H)) of -60 mV was 169.7??6.3 pA (n=18). The amplitude of ATP-induced currents increased in sigmoidal fashion over the concentration range between 0.3 and 300 ??M with a Hill coefficient (n) of 1.2 and a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 11.7 ??M. The potency order of purinergic analogues in ATP-induced current, which was 2MeSATP{\textgreater}ATP??s???ATP{\textgreater}??,??-ATP{\textgreater}ADP=AMP???adenosine=UTP, was consistent with the properties of the P(2Y) receptor. The independence of the reversal potential of the ATP-induced current from Cl- concentration suggests that the current is carried by a cation channel. The relative ionic permeability ratio of the channel modulated by ATP for cations was Ca2+{\textgreater}Na+{\textgreater}Li+{\textgreater}Ba2+{\textgreater}Cs+=K+. ATP (10 ??M) increased [Ca2+](i) in an external Ca2+-free solution to a lesser degree than that in the external solution containing 1.13 mM CaCl2. ATP-induced increase in [Ca2+](i) can be mimicked by application of ionomycin in a Ca2+-free solution. These results indicate that ATP increases [Ca2+](i) through the P(2Y) receptor with a subsequent activation of the non-selective cation channel, and that these effects of ATP are dependent on [Ca2+](i) and extracellular Ca2+.

	Abstract = {Deposition of beta-amyloid along cerebral vessels is found in most patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The effects of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) on the function of cerebral blood vessels were analyzed applying cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based fMRI to transgenic arcA beta mice. In a cortical brain region of interest (ROI), displaying high CAA, arcA beta mice older than 16 months showed reduced response to the vasodilatory substance acetazolamide compared to age-matched wild-type animals, both with regard to rate (vascular reactivity) and extent of vasodilation (maximal vasodilation). In a subcortical ROI, displaying little CAA, no genotype-specific decrease was observed, but maximal vasodilation decreased with age in arcA beta and wild-types. These findings indicate that vascular beta-amyloid deposits reduce the capacity of cerebral blood vessels to dilate upon demand, supporting the hypothesis that vascular beta-amyloid contributes to hypoperfusion and neurological deficits observed in AD and CAA. High diagnostic accuracy of the combined readouts in detecting vascular dysfunction in arcA beta mice was found.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of modelling the negative-feedback control mechanism of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis is to describe the clinical course of euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism and overt hypothyroidism for patients. Thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels are controlled by negative-feedback control through thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). T4, like other hormones, can be bound or unbound; the unbound T4 (FT4) is used as a marker for hypothyroidism. Autoimmune thyroiditis is a disease in which the thyroid-infiltrating lymphocytes attack autoantigens in follicle cells, destroying them over a long time. To describe the operation of the feedback control, we developed a mathematical model involving four clinical variables: TSH, FT4, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and the thyroid gland's functional size. The first three variables are regularly measured while the last variable is determined through relationships between the other three variables. The problem of two different time scales for circulating hormones and thyroid damage is addressed using singular perturbation theory. Analysis of the mathematical model establishes stability and conditions under which the diseased state can maintain the slow movement toward diseased state equilibrium. Although we have used four variables in modelling the feedback control through the HPT axis, the predicted clinical course given any set of parameters is shown to depend on the steady-state levels of TSH and FT4. This observation makes possible the development of the clinical charts based only on the levels of TSH, time and potential steady-state values. To validate the model predictions, a dataset obtained from a Sicilian adult population has been employed.},

@article{McSherry2005,
	Abstract = {In rat mesenteric arteries, the ability of ACh to evoke hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells and consummate dilatation relies on an increase in endothelial cell cytosolic free [Ca2+] and activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa). The time course of average and spatially organized rises in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i and concomitant effects on membrane potential were investigated in individual cells of pressurized arteries and isolated sheets of native cells stimulated with ACh. In both cases, ACh stimulated a sustained and oscillating rise in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i. Overall, the oscillations remained asynchronous between cells, yet occasionally localized intercellular coordination became evident. In pressurized arteries, repetitive waves of Ca2+ moved longitudinally across endothelial cells, and depended on Ca2+-store refilling. The rise in endothelial cell Ca2+ was associated with sustained hyperpolarization of endothelial cells in both preparations. This hyperpolarization was also evident when recording from smooth muscle cells in pressurized arteries, and from resting membrane potential, selective inhibition of small-conductance KCa (SKCa) with apamin (50 nM) was sufficient to inhibit this response. In the presence of phenylephrine-tone, both apamin and the selective inhibitor of intermediate conductance KCa (IKCa) TRAM-34 (1 ??M) were required to inhibit the non-nitric oxide-mediated dilatation to ACh. When hyperpolarization of endothelial cells was fully prevented either with inhibitors of KCa or in KCl (35 mM)-depolarized cells, both the time course and frequency of oscillations in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i to ACh were unaffected. Together, these data show that although a rise in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i stimulates hyperpolarization, depletion of intracellular stores with ACh stimulates Ca2+-influx which is not significantly influenced by the increase in cellular electrochemical gradient for Ca2+ caused by that hyperpolarization. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Migraine is a common, recurrent, and disabling primary headache disorder with a genetic component which affects up to 20{\%} of the population. One third of all patients with migraine experiences aura, a focal neurological disturbance that manifests itself as visual, sensitive or motor symptoms preceding the headache. In the pathophysiology of migraine with aura, activation of the trigeminovascular system from the meningeal vessels mediates migraine pain via the brainstem and projections ascend to the thalamus and cortex. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was proposed to trigger migraine aura and to activate perivascular trigeminal nerves in the cortex. Quinine, quinidine and the derivative mefloquine are able to inhibit CSD suggesting an involvement of neuronal connexin36 channels in CSD propagation. More recently, CSD was shown to induce headache by activating the trigeminovascular system through the opening of stressed neuronal Pannexin1 channels. A novel benzopyran compound, tonabersat, was selected for clinical trial on the basis of its inhibitory activity on CSD and neurogenic inflammation in animal models of migraine. Interestingly, in the time course of animal model trials, tonabersat was shown to inhibit trigeminal ganglion (TGG) neuronal-glial cell gap junctions, suggesting that this compound could prevent peripheral sensitization within the ganglion. Three clinical trials aimed at investigating the effectiveness of tonabersat as a preventive drug were negative, and conflicting results were obtained in other trials concerning its ability to relieve attacks. In contrast, in another clinical trial, tonabersat showed a preventive effect on attacks of migraine with aura but had no efficacy on non-aura attacks. Gap junction channels seem to be involved in several ways in the pathophysiology of migraine with aura and emerge as a new promising putative target in treatment of this disorder.},

	Abstract = {Cerebral blood flow adequate for brain activity and metabolic demand is maintained through the processes of autoregulation and neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes undoubtedly make an important contribution to these processes. The critical factors that determine the polarity of astrocytic response include: metabolites (e.g., arachidonic acid and its derivatives, lactate and oxygen concentrations), ions (H+, Ca2+ and K+), gliotransmitters (glutamate, Glu; gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA; d-serine; adenosine 5'-triphosphate, ATP and brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF), neuronal activity and vascular tone.Although the astrocytic contribution to neurovascular coupling has been intensively studied, a few important questions still remain, such as: (1) the modulatory function of astrocytes in tripartite synapses, including effects related to the strength of synaptic stimulation and the particular signaling pathway (astrocytic or neuronal) that becomes activated, (2) the significance of the vasoconstrictive reaction evoked by arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g., 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 20-HETE) under both physiological and pathological conditions, (3) the relationship between brain activity level and metabolic processes occurring in astrocytes, which is studied using neuroradiological techniques and (4) the astrocytic contribution to the neurovascular response under pathological conditions. Hence, the function of astrocytes in neurovascular coupling remains ambiguous. The function of astrocytes is beneficial and integrative in physiological conditions, but under definitive pathological conditions may become detrimental and involved in the development of diseases like ischemic stroke, arterial hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

Expression of eNOS is altered in many types of cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypertension. The ubiquitous chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) associates with NOS and is important for its proper folding and function. Current studies point toward a therapeutic potential by modulating hsp90-NOS association in various vascular diseases. Here we review the transcriptional regulation of endothelial NOS and factors affecting eNOS activity and function, as well as the important vascular pathologies associated with altered NOS function, focusing on the regulatory role of hsp90 and other factors in NO-associated pathogenesis of these diseases. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Endothelial expression of the gap junction proteins, connexin (Cx) 37, Cx40, and Cx43, varies within the vascular network. While previous studies suggest that shear stress may upregulate Cx43, it is not well understood if shear stress affects the expression of all endothelial connexins and to what extent. Endothelial cells on the upstream and downstream surfaces of cardiac valves are subjected to considerably different intensities of shear stress. We therefore reasoned that we could determine the extent hemodynamic forces affect the expression of Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 by comparing their immunohistochemical distribution on the upstream and downstream surfaces of rat cardiac valves. We found 70- to 200-fold greater expression of Cx43 in the endothelial cells on the upstream than on the downstream surfaces. However, Cx37 was expressed almost equally in the endothelial cells on upstream and downstream surfaces, and Cx40, a major connexin in most vascular endothelial cells, was not detected on either surface. In addition to the heterogeneity in Cx43 expression, endothelial cells on the upstream surface were 35{\%} to 65{\%} smaller than those on the corresponding downstream surface. These results suggest that shear stress may affect endothelial cell size and Cx43 expression but not Cx37 expression.},

	Abstract = {The cloned BK channel alpha subunit from human myometrium was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, either alone (CHOalpha cells) or in combination with the auxiliary beta subunit (CHOalpha+beta cells). We studied basic channel properties and the effects of cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases on the BK channel activity. Coexpression of alpha and beta subunits enhanced the Ca2+ and voltage sensitivity of the BK channel, and decreased the inhibitory potency of iberiotoxin. Blocking and stimulating effects on BK channel activity by charybdotoxin and nitric oxide, respectively, were independent of the beta subunit. The cGMP kinase Ialpha and cAMP kinase failed to affect BK channel activity in CHOalpha and CHOalpha+beta cells at different [Ca2+]i and voltages. In contrast, BK channels in freshly isolated myometrial cells from postmenopausal women responded to cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase with a fourfold and twofold decrease in their open probability (NPo), respectively. These effects could be reversed by alkaline phosphatase and remained unaffected by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (100 nM). In 28{\%} of myometrial cells, however, cAMP and cGMP kinases increased NPo 2-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. This stimulation was enhanced rather than reversed by alkaline phosphatase and was abolished by 100 nM okadaic acid. The results suggest that in stably transfected CHO cells the expressed BK channel is not regulated by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase. However, in native myometrial cells stimulatory and inhibitory regulation of BK channels by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase was observed, suggesting that channel regulation by the protein kinases requires factors that are not provided by CHO cells. Alternatively, failure of regulation may have been due to the primary structure of the myometrial BK channel protein used in this study.},

	Abstract = {A system of differential equations describing stationary vasomotion is formulated. It incorporates the ionic transports, cell-membrane potential, muscle contraction of the vessel smooth muscle cells, and the mechanics of a thick-walled cylinder. It is shown that the interaction of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes mediated by voltage-gated and voltage-calcium-gated channels, respectively, brings about periodicity of those transports. This results on a time-periodic cytoplasmic calcium concentration, myosin light chains phosphorylation, and crossbridges formation with the attending muscle stress. The vessel's transmural pressure determines a hoop stress. The resultant hoop, elastic, and muscle stresses determine the rate of change of the vessel's diameter: vasomotion. The model results agree with the experimental observations. The sensitivity of the vasomotion's dependence on parameter values and its significance to experimental protocols are examined. Further, it is hypothesized that the dependence of calcium-channel openings on voltage is shifted by changes on transmural pressure. Thus, Harder's experimental results are reproduced, among them the decreasing of vessel diameter with increasing pressure. Those behaviors are associated with a pattern of change of the singularities of the system of equations describing the model. This suggests a functional relationship on the interactions of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes responsible for the myogenic response; it may not result from a single molecular mechanism. The model is constructed so that additional experimental information can be readily incorporated.},

	Abstract = {The constant perfusion of a human organ with nutrients and oxygen demands a robust regulatory mechanisms in the face of normal day-to-day pressure variations in the vasculature. The brain, in a similar manner to the heart requires this mechanism to be extremely quick acting, relative to other ways of altering perfusion such as varying systemic blood pressure, since oxygen depravation in the tissues of the brain can be tolerated for only of the order of tens of seconds before significant damage can be done. In recent years computational models, and it must be noted computer architecture have evolved to an extent where mathematicians and engineers can play a large part in discovering how the brain functions physiologically as well as investigating pathological conditions. This review will look at a number of increasingly complex computational models of blood flow to the brain and how variations in arterial geometry can influence the perfusion in the cerebral vasculature. Although these models have provided an insight into complex mechanisms the research area is densely populated with important questions that perhaps only computer models can answer. The review will indicate possible areas of investigation. {\textcopyright} 2008 IPEM.},

	Abstract = {Synaptic transmission relies on several processes, such as the location of a released vesicle, the number and type of receptors, trafficking between the postsynaptic density (PSD) and extrasynaptic compartment, as well as the synapse organization. To study the impact of these parameters on excitatory synaptic transmission, we present a computational model for the fast AMPA-receptor mediated synaptic current. We show that in addition to the vesicular release probability, due to variations in their release locations and the AMPAR distribution, the postsynaptic current amplitude has a large variance, making a synapse an intrinsic unreliable device. We use our model to examine our experimental data recorded from CA1 mice hippocampal slices to study the differences between mEPSC and evoked EPSC variance. The synaptic current but not the coefficient of variation is maximal when the active zone where vesicles are released is apposed to the PSD. Moreover, we find that for certain type of synapses, receptor trafficking can affect the magnitude of synaptic depression. Finally, we demonstrate that perisynaptic microdomains located outside the PSD impacts synaptic transmission by regulating the number of desensitized receptors and their trafficking to the PSD. We conclude that geometrical modifications, reorganization of the PSD or perisynaptic microdomains modulate synaptic strength, as the mechanisms underlying long-term plasticity.},

Kir4.1 is the only Kir channel so far shown to be expressed in brain glial cells. We examined the distribution of Kir4.1 in rat brain with a specific antibody. The Kir4.1 immunostaining distributed broadly but not diffusely in the brain. It was strong in some regions such as the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, the Bergmann glia in the cerebellum, the ependyma, and pia mater, while little activity was detected in white matter of the corpus callosum or cerebellar peduncle. In the olfactory bulb, Kir4.1 immunoreactivity was detected in a scattered manner in about one-half of the glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. Immunoelectron microscopic examination revealed that Kir4.1 channels were enriched on the processes of astrocytes wrapping synapses and blood vessels. These data suggest that Kir4.1 is expressed in a limited population of brain astrocytes and may play a specific role in the glial K(+)-buffering action.},

@article{Chander2012,
	Abstract = {We present a computational, biophysical model of neuron-astrocyte-vessel interaction. Unlike other cells, neurons convey "hunger" signals to the vascular network via an intervening layer of glial cells (astrocytes); vessels dilate and release glucose which fuels neuronal firing. Existing computational models focus on only parts of this loop (neuron→astrocyte→vessel→neuron), whereas the proposed model describes the entire loop. Neuronal firing causes release of a neurotransmitter like glutamate which triggers release of vasodilator by astrocytes via a cascade of biochemical events. Vasodilators released from astrocytic endfeet cause blood vessels to dilate and release glucose into the interstitium, part of which is taken up by the astrocyticendfeet. Glucose is converted into lactate in the astrocyte and transported into the neuron. Glucose from the interstitium and lactate (produced from glucose) influx from astrocyte are converted into ATP in the neuron. Neuronal ATP is used to drive the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase pumps, which maintain ionic gradients necessary for neuronal firing. When placed in the metabolic loop, the neuron exhibits sustained firing only when the stimulation current is more than a minimum threshold. For various combinations of initial neuronal [ATP] and external current, the neuron exhibits a variety of firing patterns including sustained firing, firing after an initial pause, burst firing etc. Neurovascular interactions under conditions of constricted vessels are also studied. Most models of cerebral circulation describe neurovascular interactions exclusively in the "forward" neuron→vessel direction. The proposed model indicates possibility of "reverse" influence also, with vasomotion rhythms influencing neural firing patterns. Another idea that emerges out of the proposed work is that brain's computations may be more comprehensively understood in terms of neuro-glial-vascular dynamics and not in terms of neural firing alone.},

@article{Munoz2015,
	Abstract = {Neuronal activity must be tightly coordinated with blood flow to keep proper brain function, which is achieved by a mechanism known as neurovascular coupling. Then, an increase in synaptic activity leads to a dilation of local parenchymal arterioles that matches the enhanced metabolic demand. Neurovascular coupling is orchestrated by astrocytes. These glial cells are located between neurons and the microvasculature, with the astrocytic endfeet ensheathing the vessels, which allows fine intercellular communication. The neurotransmitters released during neuronal activity reach astrocytic receptors and trigger a Ca(2+) signaling that propagates to the endfeet, activating the release of vasoactive factors and arteriolar dilation. The astrocyte Ca(2+) signaling is coordinated by gap junction channels and hemichannels formed by connexins (Cx43 and Cx30) and channels formed by pannexins (Panx-1). The neuronal activity-initiated Ca(2+) waves are propagated among neighboring astrocytes directly via gap junctions or through ATP release via connexin hemichannels or pannexin channels. In addition, Ca(2+) entry via connexin hemichannels or pannexin channels may participate in the regulation of the astrocyte signaling-mediated neurovascular coupling. Interestingly, nitric oxide (NO) can activate connexin hemichannel by S-nitrosylation and the Ca(2+)-dependent NO-synthesizing enzymes endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) are expressed in astrocytes. Therefore, the astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling triggered in neurovascular coupling may activate NO production, which, in turn, may lead to Ca(2+) influx through hemichannel activation. Furthermore, NO release from the hemichannels located at astrocytic endfeet may contribute to the vasodilation of parenchymal arterioles. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling that mediates neurovascular coupling, with a special emphasis in the possible participation of NO in this process.},

@article{Koenigsberger2004,
	Abstract = {Many experimental studies have shown that arterial smooth muscle cells respond with cytosolic calcium rises to vasoconstrictor stimulation. A low vasoconstrictor concentration gives rise to asynchronous spikes in the calcium concentration in a few cells (asynchronous flashing). With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffusion does not play an important role to achieve synchronization. Our model is validated by published in vitro experiments obtained on rat mesenteric arterial segments.},

	Abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that high-viscosity (HV) plasma in extreme hemodilution causes wall shear stress to be greater than low-viscosity (LV) plasma, leading to enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO). The perivascular concentration of NO was measured in arterioles and venules and the tissue of the hamster chamber window model, subjected to acute extreme hemodilution, with a hematocrit (Hct) of 11{\%} using Dextran 500 (n = 6) or Dextran 70 (n = 5) with final plasma viscosities of 1.99 +/- 0.11 and 1.33 +/- 0.04 cp, respectively. HV plasma significantly increased the periarteriolar, perivenular, and tissue NO concentration by 2.0, 1.9, and 1.4 times the control (n = 7). The NO concentration with LV plasma was not statistically different from control. Arteriolar shear stress was significantly increased in HV plasma relative to LV plasma in arterioles but not in venules. Aortic endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein expression was increased with HV plasma but not with LV plasma. There was a weak correlation between perivascular NO concentration and the locally calculated shear stress induced by the procedures, when blood viscosity was corrected according to Hct values previously determined in studies of microvascular Hct distribution. The finding that the periarteriolar and venular NO concentration in HV plasma was the same although arteriolar shear stress was significantly greater than venular shear stress maybe be due to differences in vessel wall metabolism between arterioles and venules and the presence of NO transport through the blood stream in the microcirculation. Results support the concept that in extreme hemodilution HV plasma maintains functional capillary density through a NO-mediated vasodilatation.},

@article{DeLaTorre2000,
	Abstract = {Evidence is fast accumulating which indicates that Alzheimer's disease is a vascular disorder with neurodegenerative consequences rather than a neurodegenerative disorder with vascular consequences. It is proposed that two factors need to be present for AD to develop: (1) advanced ageing, (2) presence of a condition that lowers cerebral perfusion, such as a vascular-risk factor. The first factor introduces a normal but potentially insidious process that lowers cerebral blood flow in inverse relation to increased ageing; the second factor adds a crucial burden which further lowers brain perfusion and places vulnerable neurons in a state of high energy compromise leading to a cascade of neuronal metabolic turmoil. Convergence of the two factors above will culminate in a critically attained threshold of cerebral hypoperfusion (CATCH). CATCH is a hemodynamic microcirculatory insufficiency that will destabilize neurons, synapses, neurotransmission and cognitive function, creating in its wake a neurodegenerative state characterized by the formation of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid angiopathy and in some cases, Lewy bodies. Since any of a considerable number of vascular-related conditions must be present in the ageing individual for cognition to be disturbed, CATCH identifies an important aspect of the heterogeneic disease profile assumed to be present in the AD syndrome. It is proposed that CATCH initiates AD by distorting regional brain capillary structure involving endothelial cell shape changes and impairment of nitric oxide (NO) release which affect signaling between the immune, cardiovascular and nervous systems. Evidence is presented that in many tissues there is a basal level of NO being produced and that the actions of several signaling molecules may initiate increases in basal NO levels. Moreover, these temporary increases in basal NO levels exert inhibitory cellular actions, via cellular conformational changes. Findings indicate that (a) constitutive NO is responsible for a basal or 'tonal' level of NO; (b) this NO keeps particular types of cells in a state of inhibition and (c) activation of these cells occurs through disinhibition. Consequently, tissues not maintaining a basal NO level are more prone to excitatory, immune, vascular and neural influences. Under such circumstances, these tissues cannot be down-regulated to normal basal levels, thus prolonging their excitatory state. Thus, the clinical convergence of advanced ageing in the presence of a chronic, pre-morbid vascular risk factor, can, in time, contribute to an endotheliopathy involving basal NO deficit, to the degree where regional metabolic dysfunction leads to cognitive meltdown and to progressive neurodegeneration characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

	Abstract = {Polynomial chaos (PC) expansions are used in stochastic finite element analysis to represent the random model response by a set of coefficients in a suitable (so-called polynomial chaos) basis. The number of terms to be computed grows dramatically with the size of the input random vector, which makes the computational cost of classical solution schemes (may it be intrusive (i.e.of Galerkin type) or non-intrusive) unaffordable when the deterministic finite element model is expensive to evaluate. To address such problems, this paper describes a non-intrusive method that builds a sparse PC expansion. An adaptive regression-based algorithm is proposed for automatically detecting the significant coefficients of the PC expansion. Besides the sparsity of the basis, the experimental design used at each step of the algorithm is systematically complemented in order to ensure the well-posedness of the various regression problems. The accuracy of the PC model is checked using classical tools of statistical learning theory (e.g.??leave-one-out cross-validation). As a consequence, a rather small number of PC terms is eventually retained (sparse representation), which may be obtained at a reduced computational cost compared to the classical "full" PC approximation. The convergence of the algorithm is shown on an academic example. Then the method is illustrated on two stochastic finite element problems, namely a truss and a frame structure involving 10 and 21 input random variables, respectively. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit. Aspects of the mslo data not well fitted by the simplified scheme will likely be better accounted for by this more general scheme. The kinetic schemes discussed in this paper may be useful in interpreting the effects of BK channel modifications or mutations.},

Z. 49, 333-369] in which they showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. Because the original text was written in German yet is often quoted by English-speaking authors, we undertook a complete translation of the 1913 publication, which we provide as Supporting Information . Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten's data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather V(max)/K(m), the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (k(cat)/K(m) × E(0)).},

Here we show that cortical astrocytes in vivo possess a powerful mechanism for rapid vasodilation. We imaged the activity of astrocytes labeled with the calcium (Ca(2+))-sensitive indicator rhod-2 in somatosensory cortex of adult mice. Photolysis of caged Ca(2+) in astrocytic endfeet ensheathing the vessel wall was associated with an 18{\%} increase in arterial cross-section area that corresponded to a 37{\%} increase in blood flow. Vasodilation occurred with a latency of only 1-2 s, and both indomethacin and the cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor SC-560 blocked the photolysis-induced hyperemia. These observations implicate astrocytes in the control of local microcirculation and suggest that one of their physiological roles is to mediate vasodilation in response to increased neural activity.},

The two kinetically distinct components are differentially affected when Sr2+ is substituted for Ca2+ ions. Our findings are comparable to those of the classical studies for the frog neuromuscular junction, and thus the basic aspects of Ca(2+)-activated transmitter release machinery appear to be conserved in central synapses. The method we have used, in addition, permits us to estimate the average neurotransmitter release rate for a single bouton. The observation of differential Ca2+/Sr2+ sensitivity is consistent with a release mechanism mediated by two Ca2+ sensors with distinct Ca2+ affinities: the low-affinity Ca2+ sensor facilitates the fast synchronous phase of release, whereas the high-affinity sensor sustains the slow asynchronous phase of release.},

Scaling synapses to physiological numbers had little effect on performance, since our decomposition approach generates synapses that are almost always computed locally.

	Abstract = {Low and oscillatory wall shear stress is widely assumed to play a key role in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Indeed, some studies have relied on the low shear theory when developing diagnostic and treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease. We wished to ascertain if this consensus is justified by published data. We performed a systematic review of papers that compare the localization of atherosclerotic lesions with the distribution of haemodynamic indicators calculated using computational fluid dynamics. The review showed that although many articles claim their results conform to the theory, it has been interpreted in different ways: a range of metrics has been used to characterize the distribution of disease, and they have been compared with a range of haemodynamic factors. Several studies, including all of those making systematic point-by-point comparisons of shear and disease, failed to find the expected relation. The various pre- and post-processing techniques used by different groups have reduced the range of shears over which correlations were sought, and in some cases are mutually incompatible. Finally, only a subset of the known patterns of disease has been investigated. The evidence for the low/oscillatory shear theory is less robust than commonly assumed. Longitudinal studies starting from the healthy state, or the collection of average flow metrics derived from large numbers of healthy vessels, both in conjunction with point-by-point comparisons using appropriate statistical techniques, will be necessary to improve our understanding of the relation between blood flow and atherogenesis.},

	Abstract = {Conduction of arteriolar vasodilation is initiated by activation of nitric oxide (NO) mechanisms, but dependent on conduction of hyperpolarization. Most studies have used brief ({\textless}1 second) activation of the initial vasodilation to evaluate the fast conduction processes. However, most arteriolar mechanisms involving NO production persist for minutes. In this study, fast and slower components of arteriolar conduction in the in vivo rat brain and small intestine were compared using three-minute stimulation of NO-dependent vasodilation and measurement of [NO] at the distal sites. Within 10-15 seconds, both vasculatures had a rapidly conducted vasodilation and dilation at distance had a fast but small [NO] component. A slower but larger distal vasodilation occurred after 60-90 seconds in the intestine, but not the brain, and was associated with a substantial increase in [NO]. This slowly developed dilation appeared to be caused by flow mediated responses of larger arterioles as smaller arterioles dilated to lower downstream resistance. These results indicate while the intestinal and cerebral arterioles have a fast conducted vasodilation system, the intestinal arterioles also have a slower but larger dilation of major arterioles that is NO related and dependent on the conduction of vasodilation between small arterioles.},

	Abstract = {Understanding cerebral energy metabolism in neurons and astrocytes is necessary for the interpretation of functional brain imaging data. It has been suggested that astrocytes can provide lactate as an energy fuel to neurons, a process referred to as astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). Some authors challenged this hypothesis, defending the classical view that glucose is the major energy substrate of neurons, at rest as well as in response to a stimulation. To test the ANLS hypothesis from a theoretical point of view, we developed a mathematical model of compartmentalized energy metabolism between neurons and astrocytes, adopting hypotheses highly unfavorable to ANLS. Simulation results can be divided between two groups, depending on the relative neuron versus astrocyte stimulation. If this ratio is low, ANLS is observed during all the stimulus and poststimulus periods (continuous ANLS), but a high ratio induces ANLS only at the beginning of the stimulus and during the poststimulus period (triphasic behavior). Finally, our results show that current experimental data on lactate kinetics are compatible with the ANLS hypothesis, and that it is essential to assess the neuronal and astrocytic NADH/NAD+ ratio changes to test the ANLS hypothesis.},

The heterogeneity of the reaction field is shown to stochastically generate unidirectional sites, which can induce spiral waves. Furthermore, we found that the spiral wave vanished with only a small reduction in the excitability of the reaction field.

	Abstract = {Abstract Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are endothelium-derived arachidonic acid metabolites of cytochrome P450. They dilate coronary arteries, open K+ channels, and hyperpolarize vascular smooth muscles. However, the mechanisms of these smooth muscle actions remain unknown. This study examined the effects of EETs on the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa) in smooth muscle cells of small bovine coronary arteries. In cell-attached patch-clamp experiments, 11,12-EET produced a 0.5- to 10-fold increase in the activity of the KCa channels when added in concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 nmol/L. In the inside-out excised membrane patch mode, 11,12-EET was without effect on the activity of the KCa channel unless GTP (0.5 mmol/L) or GTP and ATP (1 mmol/L) were added to the bath solution. In the presence of GTP and ATP, the increase in the KCa channel activity with 11,12-EET in inside-out patches was comparable to that in cell-attached patches. This effect of 11,12-EET in inside-out patches was blocked by the addition of GDP-{\$}\beta{\$}-S (100 {\$}\mu{\$}mol/L). In outside-out patches, 11,12-EET also increased the KCa channel activity when GTP and ATP were added to the pipette solution. The addition of a specific anti-GS{\$}\alpha{\$} antibody (100 nmol/L) in the pipette solution completely blocked the activation of the KCa channels induced by 11,12-EET. An anti-G{\$}\beta{\$}{\$}\gamma{\$} or anti-Gi{\$}\alpha{\$} antibody was without effect. We conclude that 11,12-EET activates the KCa channels by a GS{\$}\alpha{\$}-mediated mechanism. This mechanism contributes to the effects of EETs as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors to hyperpolarize and relax arterial smooth muscle.},

	Abstract = {Short-term facilitation and depression refer to the increase and decrease of synaptic strength under repetitive stimuli within a timescale of milliseconds to seconds. This phenomenon has been attributed to primarily presynaptic mechanisms such as calcium-dependent transmitter release and presynaptic vesicle depletion. Previous modeling studies that aimed to integrate the complex short-term facilitation and short-term depression data derived from varying synapses have relied on computer simulation or abstract mathematical approaches. Here, we propose a unified theory of synaptic short-term plasticity based on realistic yet tractable and testable model descriptions of the underlying intracellular biochemical processes. Analysis of the model equations leads to a closed-form solution of the resonance frequency, a function of several critical biophysical parameters, as the single key indicator of the propensity for synaptic facilitation or depression under repetitive stimuli. This integrative model is supported by a broad range of transient and frequency response experimental data including those from facilitating, depressing or mixed-mode synapses. Specifically, the theory predicts that high calcium initial concentration and large gain of calcium action result in low resonance frequency and hence depressing behavior. In contrast, for synapses that are less sensitive to calcium or have higher recovery rate, resonance frequency becomes higher and thus facilitation prevails. The notion of resonance frequency therefore allows valuable quantitative parametric assessment of the contributions of various presynaptic mechanisms to the directionality of synaptic short-term plasticity. Thus, the model provides the reasons behind the switching behavior between facilitation and depression observed in experiments.

	Abstract = {Two-way communication between neurons and nonneural cells called glia is essential for axonal conduction, synaptic transmission, and information processing and thus is required for normal functioning of the nervous system during development and throughout adult life. The signals between neurons and glia include ion fluxes, neurotransmitters, cell adhesion molecules, and specialized signaling molecules released from synaptic and nonsynaptic regions of the neuron. In contrast to the serial flow of information along chains of neurons, glia communicate with other glial cells through intracellular waves of calcium and via intercellular diffusion of chemical messengers. By releasing neurotransmitters and other extracellular signaling molecules, glia can affect neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission and perhaps coordinate activity across networks of neurons.},

	Abstract = {The computational method of constrained constructive optimization (CCO) has been generalized in two important respects: (1) arterial model trees are now grown within a convex, three-dimensional piece of tissue and (2) terminal flow variability has been incorporated into the model to account for the heterogeneity of blood flow observed in real vascular beds. Although no direct information from topographic anatomy enters the model, computer- generated CCO trees closely resemble corrosion casts of real arterial trees, both on a visual basis and with regard to morphometric parameters. Terminal flow variability was found to induce transitions in the connective structure early in the trees' development. The present generalization of CCO offers - for the first time - the possibility to generate optimized arterial model trees in three dimensions, representing a realistic geometrical substrate for hemodynamic simulation studies. With the implementation of terminal flow variability the model is ready to simulate processes such as the adaptation of arterial diameters to changes in blood flow rate or the formation of different patterns of angiogenesis induced by changing needs of blood supply.},

Several mechanisms play a role in cerebral autoregulation in order to adjust vascular tone and caliber of the cerebral vessels, but the exact etiology of the dynamics of these mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we discuss two patient specific models predicting cerebral blood flow velocity during postural change from sitting to standing. One model characterises cerebral autoregulation, the other describes the beat-to-beat distribution of blood flow to the major regions of the brain.

	Abstract = {The Valsalva maneuver (VM) produces large and abrupt changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) that challenge cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. We examined the effect of VM intensity on middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and cortical oxygenation responses during (phases I-III) and following (phase IV) a VM. Healthy participants (n = 20 mean $\pm$ SD: 27 $\pm$ 7 years) completed 30 and 90{\%} of their maximal VM mouth pressure for 10 s (order randomized) whilst standing. Beat-to-beat MCAv, cerebral oxygenation (NIRS) and MAP across the different phases of the VM are reported as the difference from standing baseline. There were significant interaction (phase (*) intensity) effects for MCAv, total oxygenation index (TOI) and MAP (all P {\textless}0.01). MCAv decreased during phases II and III (P {\textless}0.01), with the greatest decrease during phase III (-5 $\pm$ 8 and -19 $\pm$ 15 cm{\textperiodcentered}s(-1) for 30 and 90{\%} VM, respectively). This pattern was also evident in TOI (phase III: -1 $\pm$ 1 and -5 $\pm$ 4{\%}, both P {\textless}0.05). Phase IV increased MCAv (22 $\pm$ 15 and 34 $\pm$ 23 cm{\textperiodcentered}s(-1)), MAP (15 $\pm$ 14 and 24 $\pm$ 17 mm Hg) and TOI (5 $\pm$ 6 and 7 $\pm$ 5{\%}) relative to baseline (all P {\textless}0.05). Cerebral autoregulation, indexed, as the {\%}MCAv/{\%}MAP ratio, showed a phase effect only (P {\textless}0.001), with the least regulation during phase IV (2.4 $\pm$ 3.0 and 3.2 $\pm$ 2.9). These data illustrate that an intense VM profoundly affects cerebral hemodynamics, with a reactive hyperemia occurring during phase IV following modest ischemia during phases II and III.},

The model is designed to explain experimental data and predict the response of the circulation and metabolism to a variety of stimuli, in particular, changes in arterial blood pressure, CO(2) levels, O(2) levels, and functional activation. Significant model outputs are predictions about blood flow, metabolic rate, and quantities measurable noninvasively using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), including cerebral blood volume and oxygenation and the redox state of the Cu(A) centre in cytochrome c oxidase. These quantities are now frequently measured in clinical settings; however the relationship between the measurements and the underlying physiological events is in general complex. We anticipate that the model will play an important role in helping to understand the NIRS signals, in particular, the cytochrome signal, which has been hard to interpret. A range of model simulations are presented, and model outputs are compared to published data obtained from both in vivo and in vitro settings. The comparisons are encouraging, showing that the model is able to reproduce observed behaviour in response to various stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Smooth muscle cell calcium dynamics and diameter were measured in intact pressurized rat mesenteric artery segments during vasoconstriction and vasomotion. Arteries showed a certain norepinephrine (NE) threshold (0.3-0.4 microM) for the onset of vasomotion, during a cumulative NE concentration-response curve. This was due to a necessary [Ca2+]i threshold (increase over basal level of 22.2 +/- 2.6{\%}) to elicit oscillations. The calcium oscillations obtained were synchronous over the entire vessel length and phase-shifted (in advance by 1.7 +/- 0.3 seconds) with respect to the diameter oscillations. A similar result was obtained using a KCl depolarization to contract the arteries, even though the [Ca2+]i threshold was much smaller in this case (increase over basal level of 9.9 +/- 4.3{\%}), as compared with the NE-elicited vasomotion. Blockade of the Na+/K+-ATPase with 1 microM ouabain, or of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) with 1 microM KB-R 7943, did not abolish the calcium oscillations, thus showing that these two pumps are only modulatory elements, while on the other hand, voltage-gated calcium channels have been found to be important in the vasomotion mechanism.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a three-dimensional spatially distributed model of brain cellular metabolism and investigates how the locus of the synaptic activity in reference to the capillaries and diffusion affects the behavior of the model, a type of analysis which is impossible to carry out in spatially lumped models, which are shown to be consistent spatially averaged approximations of the distributed model. To avoid a geometrically detailed modeling of the complex structure of the tissue consisting of different cell types and the extracellular space, the distributed model is based on a novel multi-domain formulation of reaction-diffusion equations, accounting also for separate mitochondria. The model reduction relating the spatially distributed model and lower dimensional reduced models, including the well-mixed spatially lumped compartment model, is carefully explained. We illustrate the effects of losing the spatial resolution with a computed example which is based on a reduced one-dimensional distributed radial model, and look into how the model behaves when the locus of the synaptic activity in reference to the capillaries is changed. By averaging the fluxes and concentrations in the distributed radial model to correspond to quantities in a lumped model, and further by estimating the parameters in the lumped, we conclude that varying the locus of the synaptic activity in reference to the capillaries alters significantly the lumped model parameters. This observation seems to be consequential for parameter estimation procedures from data when the spatial resolution is insufficient to determine the locus of the activity, indicating that the model uncertainty is an inherent feature of lumped models.

This consists of analyzing the effect of varying one model input factor at a time while keeping all other fixed. While the shortcomings of OAT are known from the statistical literature, its widespread use among modelers raises concern on the quality of the associated sensitivity analyses. The present paper introduces a novel geometric proof of the inefficiency of OAT, with the purpose of providing the modeling community with a convincing and possibly definitive argument against OAT.

	Abstract = {The coupling between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) during brain activation can be characterized by an empirical index n, the ratio of fractional CBF changes to fractional CMRO2 changes. Measurements of n have yielded varying results, and it is not known if the observed variability is due to measurement techniques or underlying physiology. The calibrated BOLD approach using hypercapnia offers a promising tool for assessing changes in CBF/CMRO2 coupling in health and disease, but potential systematic errors have not yet been characterized. The goal of this study was to experimentally evaluate the magnitude of bias in the estimate of n that arises from the way in which a region of interest (ROI) is chosen for averaging data and to relate this potential bias to a more general theoretical consideration of the sources of systematic errors in the calibrated BOLD experiment. Results were compared for different approaches for defining an ROI within the visual cortex based on: (1) retinotopically defined V1; (2) a functional CBF localizer; and (3) a functional BOLD localizer. Data in V1 yielded a significantly lower estimate of n (2.45) compared to either CBF (n = 3.45) or BOLD (n = 3.18) localizers. Different statistical thresholds produced biases in estimates of n with values ranging from 3.01 (low threshold) to 4.37 (high threshold). Possible sources of the observed biases are discussed. These results underscore the importance of a critical evaluation of the methodology, and the adoption of consistent standards for applying the calibrated BOLD approach to the evaluation of CBF/CMRO2 coupling. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Ho2012,
	Abstract = {Endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) is classically viewed as a regulator of vasomotor tone. NO plays an important role in regulating O(2) delivery through paracrine control of vasomotor tone locally and cardiovascular and respiratory responses centrally. Very soon after the cloning and functional characterization of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), studies on the interaction between O(2) and NO made the paradoxical finding that hypoxia led to decreases in eNOS expression and function. Why would decreases in O(2) content in tissues elicit a loss of a potent endothelial-derived vasodilator? We now know that restricting our view of NO as a regulator of vasomotor tone or blood pressure limited deeper levels of mechanistic insight. Exciting new studies indicate that functional interactions between NO and O(2) exhibit profound complexity and are relevant to diseases states, especially those associated with hypoxia in tissues. NOS isoforms catalytically require O(2). Hypoxia regulates steady-state expression of the mRNA and protein abundance of the NOS enzymes. Animals genetically deficient in NOS isoforms have perturbations in their ability to adapt to changes in O(2) supply or demand. Most interestingly, the intracellular pathways for O(2) sensing that evolved to ensure an appropriate balance of O(2) delivery and utilization intersect with NO signaling networks. Recent studies demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilization and transcriptional activity is achieved through two parallel pathways: (1) a decrease in O(2)-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of HIF and (2) S-nitrosylation of HIF pathway components. Recent findings support a role for S-nitrosothiols as hypoxia-mimetics in certain biological and/or disease settings, such as living at high altitude, exposure to small molecules that can bind NO, or anemia.},

	Abstract = {The coupling of brain cell function to the vascular system is the basis for a number of functional neuroimaging methods relevant for human studies. These include methods as diverse as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single photon emission tomography, optimal intrinsic signals, as well as near infrared spectroscopy, a method that may have imaging capabilities in the near future. These methods map a specific localized brain activation through a vascular response, such as an increase in cerebral blood flow or a change in blood oxygenation. To understand these direct maps to obtain high resolution maps of localized functional brain activity, a precise knowledge of the specific underlying physiological mechanisms and methodological properties and restrictions is essential. In this article, these fundamental physiological and methodological aspects will be discussed. After reviewing how the techniques cited obtain maps of functional activity, we will discuss our current knowledge of the physiology of coupling with particular reference to the functional imaging techniques. Specifically, we will consider the function, the mediators, and the hemodynamic mechanisms of coupling and point out potential interference by diet, and neurological disease.},

	Abstract = {Preferential locations of atherosclerotic plaque are strongly associated with the areas of low wall shear stress (WSS) and disturbed haemodynamic characteristics such as flow detachment, flow recirculation and oscillatory flow. The areas of low WSS are also associated with the reduced production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the endothelial layer, as well as the resulting reduced production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3 ). The subsequent variation in Ca2+ signalling and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis could lead to the impairment of the atheroprotective function played by NO. In previous studies it has been suggested that the reduced IP3 and v signalling can explain the correlation of atherosclerosis with induced low WSS and disturbed flow characteristics. The massively parallel implementation described in this article provides insight into the dynamics of coupled smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) mapped onto the surface of an idealised arterial bifurcation. We show that variations in coupling parameters, which model normal and pathological conditions, provide vastly different SMC Ca2+ dynamics and wave propagation profiles. The extensibility of the coupled cells model and scalability of the implementation provide a solid framework for in silico investigations of the interaction between complex cellular chemistry and the macro-scale processes determined of fluid dynamics.

	Abstract = {A computational model for the mitochondrial respiratory chain that appropriately balances mass, charge, and free energy transduction is introduced and analyzed based on a previously published set of data measured on isolated cardiac mitochondria. The basic components included in the model are the reactions at complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport system, ATP synthesis at F1F0 ATPase, substrate transporters including adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate-hydrogen co-transporter, and cation fluxes across the inner membrane including fluxes through the K+/H+ antiporter and passive H+ and K+ permeation. Estimation of 16 adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated from rat heart and liver and observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available data, it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. Specifically, it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex III is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics.},

	Abstract = {Pial arteries play a key role in the regulation of human cerebral blood flow. However, many of the features and mechanisms that regulate the tone and diameters of these vessels cannot be studied in situ. One approach is to study in vitro segments of arteries obtained during neurosurgical procedures. The ratios of arterial media thickness to lumen diameter and of the capacity to develop wall force to lumen diameter have important functional consequences and are known to change in disease. Experiments were carried out on pial arteries from normotensive humans to determine the way in which these parameters vary with vessel size. Vessel dimensions - media thickness and lumen diameter were derived from fixed sections using quantitative morphometry. Wall force was measured using a resistance artery myograph. The ratio of media thickness to lumen diameter and of maximum tension developed to lumen diameter both increased as vessel diameter decreased. These ratios do not change over the age range of 15 - 75 years. These findings show that although in vivo intralumenal pressure falls as human pial arteries become smaller, their media thickness and capacity to develop tone increase.},

	Abstract = {The cortical hemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulus is investigated at the level of individual vascular compartments using both depth-resolved optical imaging and in-vivo two-photon microscopy. We utilize a new imaging and spatiotemporal analysis approach that exploits the different characteristic dynamics of responding arteries, arterioles, capillaries and veins to isolate their three-dimensional spatial extent within the cortex. This spatial delineation is validated using vascular casts. Temporal delineation is supported by in-vivo two-photon microscopy of the temporal dynamics and vascular mechanisms of the arteriolar and venous responses. Using these techniques we have been able to characterize the roles of the different vascular compartments in generating and controlling the hemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulus. We find that changes in arteriolar total hemoglobin concentration agree well with arteriolar dilation dynamics, which in turn correspond closely with changes in venous blood flow. For 4-s stimuli, we see only small changes in venous hemoglobin concentration, and do not detect measurable dilation or ballooning in the veins. Instead, we see significant evidence of capillary hyperemia. We compare our findings to historical observations of the composite hemodynamic response from other modalities including functional magnetic resonance imaging. Implications of our results are discussed with respect to mathematical models of cortical hemodynamics, and to current theories on the mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling. We also conclude that our spatiotemporal analysis approach is capable of isolating and localizing signals from the capillary bed local to neuronal activation, and holds promise for improving the specificity of other hemodynamic imaging modalities. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Tran2012,
	Abstract = {Electrical communication and its role in blood flow regulation are built on an examination of charge movement in single, isolated vessels. How this process behaves in broader arterial networks remains unclear. This study examined the nature of electrical communication in arterial structures where vessel length and branching were varied. Analysis began with the deployment of an existing computational model expanded to form a variable range of vessel structures. Initial simulations revealed that focal endothelial stimulation generated electrical responses that conducted robustly along short unbranched vessels and to a lesser degree lengthened arteries or branching structures retaining a single branch point. These predictions matched functional observations from hamster mesenteric arteries and support the idea that an increased number of vascular cells attenuate conduction by augmenting electrical load. Expanding the virtual network to 31 branches revealed that electrical responses increasingly ascended from fifth- to first-order arteries when the number of stimulated distal vessels rose. This property enabled the vascular network to grade vasodilation and network perfusion as revealed through blood flow modeling. An elevation in endothelial-endothelial coupling resistance, akin to those in sepsis models, compromised this ascension of vasomotor/perfusion responses. A comparable change was not observed when the endothelium was focally disrupted to mimic disease states including atherosclerosis. In closing, this study highlights that vessel length and branching play a role in setting the conduction of electrical phenomenon along resistance arteries and within networks. It also emphasizes that modest changes in endothelial function can, under certain scenarios, impinge on network responsiveness and blood flow control.},

	Abstract = {The effect of vasoactive stimuli on cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been variously reported as normal or impaired by hypoglycemia. We measured regional CBF (rCBF) in contralateral somato-sensory cortex at rest and during vibrotactile stimulation of one hand in four normal awake human volunteers during fasting euglycemia (5.1-5.2 mumol/ml) with 0.9{\%} saline infusion, euglycemia (5.1-5.2 mumol/ml) with hyperinsulinemic clamp, mild hypoglycemia (3.2-3.6 mumol/ml) with hyperinsulinemic clamp, and moderate hypoglycemia (2.3-3.2 mumol/ml) with hyperinsulinemic clamp. No changes in mean arterial pressure, arterial PCO2, or arterial oxygen content occurred. There was no change in the magnitude of the normalized rCBF response to physiological brain stimulation with progressive arterial hypoglycemia (r = 0.10, P = 0.73). We interpret this to mean that there was a progressive reduction in cerebral glucose delivery to the area of physiological activation as arterial glucose concentrations fell. Therefore, the increase in rCBF during physiological brain activation is not regulated by a mechanism that matches local cerebral glucose supply to local cerebral glucose demand.},

@article{Aubert2005a,
	Abstract = {A critical issue in brain energy metabolism is whether lactate produced within the brain by astrocytes is taken up and metabolized by neurons upon activation. Although there is ample evidence that neurons can efficiently use lactate as an energy substrate, at least in vitro, few experimental data exist to indicate that it is indeed the case in vivo. To address this question, we used a modeling approach to determine which mechanisms are necessary to explain typical brain lactate kinetics observed upon activation. On the basis of a previously validated model that takes into account the compartmentalization of energy metabolism, we developed a mathematical model of brain lactate kinetics, which was applied to published data describing the changes in extracellular lactate levels upon activation. Results show that the initial dip in the extracellular lactate concentration observed at the onset of stimulation can only be satisfactorily explained by a rapid uptake within an intraparenchymal cellular compartment. In contrast, neither blood flow increase, nor extracellular pH variation can be major causes of the lactate initial dip, whereas tissue lactate diffusion only tends to reduce its amplitude. The kinetic properties of monocarboxylate transporter isoforms strongly suggest that neurons represent the most likely compartment for activation-induced lactate uptake and that neuronal lactate utilization occurring early after activation onset is responsible for the initial dip in brain lactate levels observed in both animals and humans.},

	Abstract = {Neural activity generates increases in extracellular K(+) concentration, [K(+)](0), which must be regulated in order to maintain normal brain function. Glial cells are thought to play an important part in this regulation through the process of K(+) spatial buffering--: K(+)-mediated current flow through glial cells redistributes extracellular K(+) following localized [K(+)](0) increases. As is the case in other glia, the retinal M{\"{u}}ller cell is permeable almost exclusively to K(+) (ref. ). Recent experiments-- have suggested that this K(+) conductance may not be distributed uniformly over the cell surface. In the present study, two novel techniques have been used to assess the M{\"{u}}ller cell K(+) conductance distribution. The results demonstrate that 94{\%} of all membrane conductance lies in the endfoot process of the cell. This strikingly asymmetric distribution has important consequences for theories concerning K(+) buffering and should help to explain the generation of the electroretinogram.},

@article{Bolanos1999,
	Abstract = {A large body of evidence has appeared over the last 6 years suggesting that nitric oxide biosynthesis is a key factor in the pathophysiological response of the brain to hypoxia-ischemia. Whilst studies on the influence of nitric oxide in this phenomenon initially offered conflicting conclusions, the use of better biochemical tools, such as selective inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms or transgenic animals, is progressively clarifying the precise role of nitric oxide in brain ischemia. Brain ischemia triggers a cascade of events, possibly mediated by excitatory amino acids, yielding the activation of the Ca2+-dependent NOS isoforms, i.e. neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS). However, whereas the selective inhibition of nNOS is neuroprotective, selective inhibition of eNOS is neurotoxic. Furthermore, mainly in glial cells, delayed ischemia or reperfusion after an ischemic episode induces the expression of Ca2+-independent inducible NOS (iNOS), and its selective inhibition is neuroprotective. In conclusion, it appears that activation of nNOS or induction of iNOS mediates ischemic brain damage, possibly by mitochondrial dysfunction and energy depletion. However, there is a simultaneous compensatory response through eNOS activation within the endothelium of blood vessels, which mediates vasodilation and hence increases blood flow to the damaged brain area.

	Abstract = {The main receptors for amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from brain to blood and blood to brain are low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), respectively. In normal human plasma a soluble form of LRP1 (sLRP1) is a major endogenous brain Abeta 'sinker' that sequesters some 70 to 90 {\%} of plasma Abeta peptides. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the levels of sLRP1 and its capacity to bind Abeta are reduced which increases free Abeta fraction in plasma. This in turn may increase brain Abeta burden through decreased Abeta efflux and/or increased Abeta influx across the BBB. In Abeta immunotherapy, anti-Abeta antibody sequestration of plasma Abeta enhances the peripheral Abeta 'sink action'. However, in contrast to endogenous sLRP1 which does not penetrate the BBB, some anti-Abeta antibodies may slowly enter the brain which reduces the effectiveness of their sink action and may contribute to neuroinflammation and intracerebral hemorrhage. Anti-Abeta antibody/Abeta immune complexes are rapidly cleared from brain to blood via FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor) across the BBB. In a mouse model of AD, restoring plasma sLRP1 with recombinant LRP-IV cluster reduces brain Abeta burden and improves functional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and behavioral responses, without causing neuroinflammation and/or hemorrhage. The C-terminal sequence of Abeta is required for its direct interaction with sLRP and LRP-IV cluster which is completely blocked by the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that does not directly bind Abeta. Therapies to increase LRP1 expression or reduce RAGE activity at the BBB and/or restore the peripheral Abeta 'sink' action, hold potential to reduce brain Abeta and inflammation, and improve CBF and functional recovery in AD models, and by extension in AD patients.},

@article{Schmithorst2014,
	Abstract = {Functional MRI using blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) imaging has provided unprecedented insights into the maturation of the human brain. Task-based fMRI studies have shown BOLD signal increases with age during development (ages 5-18) for many cognitive domains such as language and executive function, while functional connectivity (resting-state) fMRI studies investigating regionally synchronous BOLD fluctuations have revealed a developing functional organization of the brain from a local into a more distributed architecture. However, interpretation of these results is confounded by the fact that the BOLD signal is directly related to blood oxygenation driven by changes in blood flow and only indirectly related to neuronal activity, and may thus be affected by changing neuronal-vascular coupling. BOLD signal and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured simultaneously in a cohort of 113 typically developing awake participants ages 3-18 performing a narrative comprehension task. Using a novel voxelwise wild bootstrap analysis technique, an increased ratio of BOLD signal to relative CBF signal change with age (indicative of increased neuronal-vascular coupling) was seen in the middle temporal gyri and the left inferior frontal gyrus. Additionally, evidence of decreased relative oxygen metabolism (indicative of decreased neuronal activity) with age was found in the same regions. These findings raise concern that results of developmental BOLD studies cannot be unambiguously attributed to neuronal activity. Astrocytes and astrocytic processes may significantly affect the maturing functional architecture of the brain, consistent with recent research demonstrating a key role for astrocytes in mediating increased CBF following neuronal activity and for astrocyte processes in modulating synaptic connectivity.

	Abstract = {Cortical spreading depolarization causes a breakdown of electrochemical gradients following acute brain injury, and also elicits dynamic changes in regional cerebral blood flow that range from physiological neurovascular coupling (hyperaemia) to pathological inverse coupling (hypoperfusion). In this study, we determined whether pathological inverse neurovascular coupling occurred as a mechanism of secondary brain injury in 24 patients who underwent craniotomy for severe traumatic brain injury. After surgery, spreading depolarizations were monitored with subdural electrode strips and regional cerebral blood flow was measured with a parenchymal thermal diffusion probe. The status of cerebrovascular autoregulation was monitored as a correlation between blood pressure and regional cerebral blood flow. A total of 876 spreading depolarizations were recorded in 17 of 24 patients, but blood flow measurements were obtained for only 196 events because of technical limitations. Transient haemodynamic responses were observed in time-locked association with 82 of 196 (42{\%}) spreading depolarizations in five patients. Spreading depolarizations induced only hyperaemic responses (794{\%} increase) in one patient with intact cerebrovascular autoregulation; and only inverse responses (-24{\%} decrease) in another patient with impaired autoregulation. In contrast, three patients exhibited dynamic changes in neurovascular coupling to depolarizations throughout the course of recordings. Severity of the pathological inverse response progressively increased (-14{\%}, -29{\%}, -79{\%} decrease, P {\textless} 0.05) during progressive worsening of cerebrovascular autoregulation in one patient (Pearson coefficient 0.04, 0.14, 0.28, P {\textless} 0.05). A second patient showed transformation from physiological hyperaemic coupling (44{\%} increase) to pathological inverse coupling (-30{\%} decrease) (P {\textless} 0.05) coinciding with loss of autoregulation (Pearson coefficient 0.19 {\{}$\backslash$textrightarrow{\}} 0.32, P {\textless} 0.05). The third patient exhibited a similar transformation in brain tissue oxygenation, a surrogate of blood flow, from physiologic hyperoxic responses (20{\%} increase) to pathological hypoxic responses (-14{\%} decrease, P {\textless} 0.05). Pathological inverse coupling was only observed with electrodes placed in or adjacent to evolving lesions. Overall, 31{\%} of the pathological inverse responses occurred during ischaemia ({\textless}18 ml/100 g/min) thus exacerbating perfusion deficits. Average perfusion was significantly higher in patients with good 6-month outcomes (46.8 {\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}} 6.5 ml/100 g/min) than those with poor outcomes (32.2 {\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}} 3.7 ml/100 g/min, P {\textless} 0.05). These results establish inverse neurovascular coupling to spreading depolarization as a novel mechanism of secondary brain injury and suggest that cortical spreading depolarization, the neurovascular response, cerebrovascular autoregulation, and ischaemia are critical processes to monitor and target therapeutically in the management of acute brain injury.

	Abstract = {Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), caused by dominant mutations in the NOTCH3 receptor in vascular smooth muscle, is a genetic paradigm of small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain. Recent studies using transgenic (Tg)Notch3(R169C) mice, a genetic model of CADASIL, revealed functional defects in cerebral (pial) arteries on the surface of the brain at an early stage of disease progression. Here, using parenchymal arterioles (PAs) from within the brain, we determined the molecular mechanism underlying the early functional deficits associated with this Notch3 mutation. At physiological pressure (40 mmHg), smooth muscle membrane potential depolarization and constriction to pressure (myogenic tone) were blunted in PAs from TgNotch3(R169C) mice. This effect was associated with an ∼60{\%} increase in the number of voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels, which oppose pressure-induced depolarization. Inhibition of KV1 channels with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) or treatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor agonist heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), which promotes KV1 channel endocytosis, reduced KV current density and restored myogenic responses in PAs from TgNotch3(R169C) mice, whereas pharmacological inhibition of other major vasodilatory influences had no effect. KV1 currents and myogenic responses were similarly altered in pial arteries from TgNotch3(R169C) mice, but not in mesenteric arteries. Interestingly, HB-EGF had no effect on mesenteric arteries, suggesting a possible mechanistic basis for the exclusive cerebrovascular manifestation of CADASIL. Collectively, our results indicate that increasing the number of KV1 channels in cerebral smooth muscle produces a mutant vascular phenotype akin to a channelopathy in a genetic model of SVD.},

	Abstract = {Synchronous neural oscillations are found throughout the brain and are thought to contribute to neural coding and the propagation of activity. Several proposed mechanisms of synchronization have gained support through combined theoretical and experimental investigation, including mechanisms based on coupling and correlated input. Here, we ask how correlation-induced synchrony is affected by physiological heterogeneity across neurons. To address this question, we examined cell-to-cell differences in phase-response curves (PRCs), which characterize the response of periodically firing neurons to weak perturbations. Using acute slice electrophysiology, we measured PRCs across a single class of principal neurons capable of sensory-evoked oscillations in vivo: the olfactory bulb mitral cells (MCs). Periodically firing MCs displayed a broad range of PRCs, each of which was well fit by a simple three-parameter model. MCs also displayed differences in firing rate-current relationships and in preferred firing rate ranges. Both the observed PRC heterogeneity and moderate firing rate differences (∼10 Hz) separately reduced the maximum correlation-induced synchrony between MCs by up to 25--30{\%}. Simulations further demonstrated that these components of heterogeneity alone were sufficient to account for the difference in synchronization among heterogeneous vs. homogeneous populations in vitro. Within this simulation framework, independent modulation of specific PRC features additionally revealed which aspects of PRC heterogeneity most strongly impact correlation-induced synchronization. Finally, we demonstrated good agreement of novel mathematical theory with our experimental and simulation results, providing a theoretical basis for the influence of heterogeneity on correlation-induced neural synchronization. },

	Abstract = {The goal of the present study is to construct a biophysical model of the coronary artery endothelial cell response to bradykinin. This model takes into account intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, membrane potential, a non-selective cation channel, and two Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, as well as intra- and extracellular Ca2+ sources. The model reproduces the experimental data available, and predicts certain quantities which would be hard to obtain experimentally, like the individual K+ channel currents when the membrane potential is allowed to freely evolve, the implication of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), and the total K+ released during stimulation. The main results are: (1) the large-conductance K+ channel participates only very little in the overall response; (2) EETs are required in order to explain the experimental current-potential relationships, but are not an essential component of the bradykinin response; and (3) the total K+ released during stimulation gives rise to a concentration in the intercellular space which is of millimolar order. This concentration change is compatible with the hypothesis that K+ contributes to the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor phenomenon.},

Widespread heritability of neuroanatomic traits was observed, suggesting that brain structure is under strong genetic control. Furthermore, our findings indicate that neuroimaging-based measurements of cerebral variability are sensitive to genetic mediation.

	Abstract = {The stability of cortical function depends critically on proper regulation. Under conditions of migraine and stroke a breakdown of transmembrane chemical gradients can spread through cortical tissue. A concomitant component of this emergent spatio-temporal pattern is a depolarization of cells detected as slow voltage variations. The propagation velocity of approximately 3 mm/min indicates a contribution of diffusion. We propose a mechanism for spreading depolarizations (SD) that rests upon a nonlocal or noninstantaneous feedback in a reaction-diffusion system. Depending upon the characteristic space and time scales of the feedback, the propagation of cortical SD can be suppressed by shifting the bifurcation line, which separates the parameter regime of pulse propagation from the regime where a local disturbance dies out. The optimization of this feedback is elaborated for different control schemes and ranges of control parameters.},

	Abstract = {The ER is a central element in Ca(2+) signaling, both as a modulator of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and as a locus of Ca(2+)-regulated events. During surface membrane depolarization in excitable cells, the ER may either accumulate or release net Ca(2+), but the conditions of stimulation that determine which form of net Ca(2+) transport occurs are not well understood. The direction of net ER Ca(2+) transport depends on the relative rates of Ca(2+) uptake and release via distinct pathways that are differentially regulated by Ca(2+), so we investigated these rates and their sensitivity to Ca(2+) using sympathetic neurons as model cells. The rate of Ca(2+) uptake by SERCAs (J(SERCA)), measured as the t-BuBHQ-sensitive component of the total cytoplasmic Ca(2+) flux, increased monotonically with [Ca(2+)](i). Measurement of the rate of Ca(2+) release (J(Release)) during t-BuBHQ-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients made it possible to characterize the Ca(2+) permeability of the ER (({\~{}})P(ER)), describing the activity of all Ca(2+)-permeable channels that contribute to passive ER Ca(2+) release, including ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) release channels (RyRs) that are responsible for CICR. Simulations based on experimentally determined descriptions of J(SERCA), and of Ca(2+) extrusion across the plasma membrane (J(pm)) accounted for our previous finding that during weak depolarization, the ER accumulates Ca(2+), but at a rate that is attenuated by activation of a CICR pathway operating in parallel with SERCAs to regulate net ER Ca(2+) transport. Caffeine greatly increased the [Ca(2+)] sensitivity of (({\~{}})P(ER)), accounting for the effects of caffeine on depolarization-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) elevations and caffeine-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. Extending the rate descriptions of J(SERCA), (({\~{}})P(ER)), and J(pm) to higher [Ca(2+)](i) levels shows how the interplay between Ca(2+) transport systems with different Ca(2+) sensitivities accounts for the different modes of CICR over different ranges of [Ca(2+)](i) during stimulation.},

	Abstract = {Active neurons communicate to intracerebral arterioles in part through an elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in astrocytes, leading to the generation of vasoactive signals involved in neurovascular coupling. In particular, [Ca(2+)](i) increases in astrocytic processes ("endfeet"), which encase cerebral arterioles, have been shown to result in vasodilation of arterioles in vivo. However, the spatial and temporal properties of endfoot [Ca(2+)](i) signals have not been characterized, and information regarding the mechanism by which these signals arise is lacking. [Ca(2+)](i) signaling in astrocytic endfeet was measured with high spatiotemporal resolution in cortical brain slices, using a fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator and confocal microscopy. Increases in endfoot [Ca(2+)](i) preceded vasodilation of arterioles within cortical slices, as detected by simultaneous measurement of endfoot [Ca(2+)](i) and vascular diameter. Neuronal activity-evoked elevation of endfoot [Ca(2+)](i) was reduced by inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptor Ca(2+) release channels and almost completely abolished by inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) uptake. To probe the Ca(2+) release mechanisms present within endfeet, spatially restricted flash photolysis of caged InsP(3) was utilized to liberate InsP(3) directly within endfeet. This maneuver generated large amplitude [Ca(2+)](i) increases within endfeet that were spatially restricted to this region of the astrocyte. These InsP(3)-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases were sensitive to depletion of the intracellular Ca(2+) store, but not to ryanodine, suggesting that Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release from ryanodine receptors does not contribute to the generation of endfoot [Ca(2+)](i) signals. Neuronally evoked increases in astrocytic [Ca(2+)](i) propagated through perivascular astrocytic processes and endfeet as multiple, distinct [Ca(2+)](i) waves and exhibited a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Regenerative Ca(2+) release processes within the endfeet were evident, as were localized regions of Ca(2+) release, and treatment of slices with the vasoactive neuropeptides somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal peptide was capable of inducing endfoot [Ca(2+)](i) increases, suggesting the potential for signaling between local interneurons and astrocytic endfeet in the cortex. Furthermore, photorelease of InsP(3) within individual endfeet resulted in a local vasodilation of adjacent arterioles, supporting the concept that astrocytic endfeet function as local "vasoregulatory units" by translating information from active neurons into complex InsP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) release signals that modulate arteriolar diameter.},

In the vasculature NO is released by endothelial cells where it modulates the underlying smooth muscle to regulate vascular tone. Due to the unique chemistry of NO, such as its reactive and free radical nature, it can interact with many different cellular constituents such as thiols and transition metal ions, which determine its cellular actions. In this review we also discuss many of the useful pharmacological tools that have been developed and used extensively to establish the involvement of NO in endothelium-derived relaxations. In addition, the recent literature identifying a potential source of NO in endothelial cells, which is not directly derived from endothelial nitric oxide synthase is examined. Finally, the photorelaxation phenomena, which mediates the release of NO from a vascular smooth muscle NO store, is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: Conduction of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responses in the microcirculation involves electrical coupling through gap junction channels among cells of the vascular wall. The present study determined whether reported differences in the properties of conduction along the arterioles of the epithelial hamster cheek pouch (CPA) and feed arteries of its retractor skeletal muscle (RFA) result from differences in the expression profile of specific connexin (Cx) isoforms and the gap junctions they comprise. Methods: Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and serial section electron microscopy were used to compare wall morphology and the distribution of gap junctions between respective vessels. Results: Expression of mRNA for Cx37, 40, 43 and 45 was similar between CPA and RFA. In the endothelium, Cx37, 40 and 43 proteins were expressed abundantly between adjacent cells while Cx37 was present in the smooth muscle. In both vessels, endothelial and smooth muscle cell (SMC) layers were well connected by myoendothelial gap junctions (MEGJs), which were found near endothelial cell (EC) gap junctions. Conclusions: The absence of differential gap junctional expression between CPA and RFA, in spite of documented differences in cellular conduction pathways, supports the hypothesis that conductance of vascular gap junction channels can be differentially modulated in resistance microvessels. {\textcopyright}2003 European Society of Cardiology.

	Abstract = {Neural activities trigger regional vasodilation in the brain. Diffusible messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are considered to work as vasodilators in neurovascular coupling. However, their roles are still controversial. In the present study, cortical images of neural activities and vasodilation were recorded through the intact skull of C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with urethane. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses elicited by vibratory hindpaw stimulation were followed by darkening of arteriole images reflecting vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Vasodilation was also observed in light reflection images at the wavelength of 570 nm in the same mice. We perfused the surface of the cortex under the skull with 100 ??M NG-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 10 ??M indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). These drugs suppressed vasodilation without changing flavoprotein fluorescence responses. A mixture of l-NA and indomethacin almost completely eliminated vasodilation. In mice lacking neuronal NOS (nNOS), activity-dependent vasodilation was significantly suppressed compared with that in littermate control mice, while that in mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A2 ?? (cPLA2??) was unchanged. These results indicate that NO works as a vasodilator in neurovascular coupling of the mouse somatosensory cortex. ?? 2007.},

The greatly increased incidence of AD following stroke and cerebral ischemia suggests that hypoxia is a risk factor which may accelerate AD pathogenesis by altering amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the hypoxia mediated AD pathogenesis have not been fully elucidated. In the present study we demonstrated that repeated hypoxia increased {\$}\beta{\$}-amyloid (A{\$}\beta{\$}) generation and neuritic plaques formation by elevating {\$}\beta{\$}-cleavage of APP in APPswe + PS1A246E transgenic mice.

	Abstract = {Previous studies suggested that amyloid ?? (A??)-induced disruption of astrocytic Ca2+ signalling and oxidative stress play a major role in the progression towards neuronal and glial death in Alzheimer's disease. We have recently demonstrated that Ca2+-permeable TRPV4 channels are highly expressed in rat hippocampal astrocytes and are involved in oxidative stress-induced cell damage. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that TRPV4 channels also contribute to hippocampal damage evoked by A??. Synthetic A??40 evoked cell death in hippocampal slice cultures in a concentration (0-20??M) and time (12-48h) dependent manner, after cultures were preconditioned with sublethal concentration of buthionine sulfoximine (1.5??M) which enhanced endogenous ROS production. As demonstrated by propidium iodide fluorescence, damage was observed in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and to a smaller degree in pyramidal neurons of the CA1-CA3 region, as well as in glia cells mainly at the edge of the slice. Immunocytochemistry revealed an altered pattern of TRPV4 and GFAP protein expression, and reactive astrogliosis surrounding pyramidal CA1-CA3 neurons. Neuronal and astrocytic damage was attenuated by the antioxidant Trolox, TRPV4 channel blockers Gd3+ and ruthenium red (RR), and a specific inhibitor of the redox and Ca2+-sensitive phospholipase A2 enzyme (MAFP). In disassociated co-cultures of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes without BSO preconditioning, A??40 evoked pronounced neuronal damage, enhanced the expression of TRPV4 and GFAP proteins (indicative of reactive astrogliosis), and increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes. The latter effect was attenuated by RR and in Ca2+-free media. These data show that A??40 can activate astrocytic TRPV4 channels in the hippocampus, leading to neuronal and astrocytic damage in a Ca2+ and oxidative stress-dependent manner. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Neural activity increases local blood flow in the central nervous system (CNS), which is the basis of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) and PET (positron emission tomography) functional imaging techniques. Blood flow is assumed to be regulated by precapillary arterioles, because capillaries lack smooth muscle. However, most (65{\%}) noradrenergic innervation of CNS blood vessels terminates near capillaries rather than arterioles, and in muscle and brain a dilatory signal propagates from vessels near metabolically active cells to precapillary arterioles, suggesting that blood flow control is initiated in capillaries. Pericytes, which are apposed to CNS capillaries and contain contractile proteins, could initiate such signalling. Here we show that pericytes can control capillary diameter in whole retina and cerebellar slices. Electrical stimulation of retinal pericytes evoked a localized capillary constriction, which propagated at approximately 2 microm s(-1) to constrict distant pericytes. Superfused ATP in retina or noradrenaline in cerebellum resulted in constriction of capillaries by pericytes, and glutamate reversed the constriction produced by noradrenaline. Electrical stimulation or puffing GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) receptor blockers in the inner retina also evoked pericyte constriction. In simulated ischaemia, some pericytes constricted capillaries. Pericytes are probably modulators of blood flow in response to changes in neural activity, which may contribute to functional imaging signals and to CNS vascular disease.},

	Abstract = {Brain ischemia is one of the most common causes of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the world. Brain ischemic preconditioning (BIP) refers to a transient, sublethal ischemia which results in tolerance to later, otherwise lethal, cerebral ischemia. Many attempts have been made to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection offered by ischemic preconditioning. Many studies have shown that neuroprotective mechanisms may involve a series of molecular regulatory pathways including activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and adenosine receptors; activation of intracellular signaling pathways such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and other protein kinases; upregulation of Bcl-2 and heat shock proteins (HSPs); and activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the autophagic-lysosomal pathway. A better understanding of the processes that lead to cell death after stroke as well as of the endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms by which BIP protects against brain ischemic insults could help to develop new therapeutic strategies for this devastating neurological disease. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the neuroprotective mechanisms of BIP and to discuss the possibility of mimicking ischemic preconditioning as a new strategy for preventive treatment of ischemia.},

	Abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) and depolarization waves are associated with dramatic failure of brain ion homeostasis, efflux of excitatory amino acids from nerve cells, increased energy metabolism and changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF). There is strong clinical and experimental evidence to suggest that CSD is involved in the mechanism of migraine, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. The implications of these findings are widespread and suggest that intrinsic brain mechanisms have the potential to worsen the outcome of cerebrovascular episodes or brain trauma. The consequences of these intrinsic mechanisms are intimately linked to the composition of the brain extracellular microenvironment and to the level of brain perfusion and in consequence brain energy supply. This paper summarizes the evidence provided by novel invasive techniques, which implicates CSD as a pathophysiological mechanism for this group of acute neurological disorders. The findings have implications for monitoring and treatment of patients with acute brain disorders in the intensive care unit. Drawing on the large body of experimental findings from animal studies of CSD obtained during decades we suggest treatment strategies, which may be used to prevent or attenuate secondary neuronal damage in acutely injured human brain cortex caused by depolarization waves.},

EEG was recorded inside a 3T MRI, allowing acquisition of single, whole-brain fMRI images following S{\&}W, as well as baseline images. Between 4 and 25 spike and wave complexes were captured in individuals. Four of the five individuals showed significant S{\&}W-related BOLD signal reductions (" deactivation") in the posterior cingulate (P {\textless}0.001 uncorrected). Significant changes were absent only in the individual with fewest spikes. Group analysis including all five subjects confirmed fMRI deactivation in the posterior cingulate.

In this report we provide modeling evidence that cyclic physiological activation of astroglial cells produces similar BOLD oscillations through a mechanism mediated by intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Specifically, neurotransmission induces pulses of Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes, resulting in increased cerebral perfusion and neuroactive transmitter release by these cells (i.e., gliotransmission), which in turn stimulates neuronal activity. Noticeably, the level of neuron-astrocyte cross talk regulates the periodic behavior of the Ca2+ wave-induced BOLD fluctuations. Our results suggest that the spontaneous ongoing activity of neuroglial networks is a potential source of the observed slow fMRI signal oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a relative newcomer to pharmacology, as the paper which initiated the field was published only 25 years ago. Nevertheless its impact is such that to date more than 31,000 papers have been published with NO in the title and more than 65,000 refer to it in some way. The identification of NO with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of its synthesis from L-arginine led to the realisation that the L-arginine: NO pathway is widespread and plays a variety of physiological roles. These include the maintenance of vascular tone, neurotransmitter function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and mediation of cellular defence. In addition, NO interacts with mitochondrial systems to regulate cell respiration and to augment the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus triggering mechanisms of cell survival or death. This review will focus on the role of NO in the cardiovascular system where, in addition to maintaining a vasodilator tone, it inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion and modulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases and virtually every risk factor for these appears to be associated with a reduction in endothelial generation of NO. Reduced basal NO synthesis or action leads to vasoconstriction, elevated blood pressure and thrombus formation. By contrast, overproduction of NO leads to vasodilatation, hypotension, vascular leakage, and disruption of cell metabolism. Appropriate pharmacological or molecular biological manipulation of the generation of NO will doubtless prove beneficial in such conditions.},

Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate--an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with {\textless}or=15{\%} of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.},

	Abstract = {While calcium signaling in excitable cells, such as muscle or neurons, is extensively characterized, calcium signaling in epithelial tissues is little understood. Specifically, the range of intercellular calcium signaling patterns elicited by tightly coupled epithelial cells and their function in the regulation of epithelial characteristics are little explored. We found that in Drosophila imaginal discs, a widely studied epithelial model organ, complex spatiotemporal calcium dynamics occur. We describe patterns that include intercellular waves traversing large tissue domains in striking oscillatory patterns as well as spikes confined to local domains of neighboring cells. The spatiotemporal characteristics of intercellular waves and oscillations arise as emergent properties of calcium mobilization within a sheet of gap-junction coupled cells and are influenced by cell size and environmental history. While the in vivo function of spikes, waves and oscillations requires further characterization, our genetic experiments suggest that core calcium signaling components guide actomyosin organization. Our study thus suggests a possible role for calcium signaling in epithelia but importantly, introduces a model epithelium enabling the dissection of cellular mechanisms supporting the initiation, transmission and regeneration of long-range intercellular calcium waves and the emergence of oscillations in a highly coupled multicellular sheet.},

@article{Chen2011,
	Abstract = {While a range of cellular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie control of neurovascular coupling, a comprehensive, reconciliatory model has yet to be determined. To fit with such a model, it is essential that candidate mechanisms exhibit reaction times, spatial ranges, and speeds of propagation that are consistent with the vascular manifestations of the 'hemodynamic response'. Understanding these vascular dynamics is therefore a critical step towards developing a robust model of neurovascular coupling. In this study, we utilize high-speed optical imaging of exposed rodent somatosensory cortex to explore and characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface vessels during functional hyperemia. Our high-speed, high-resolution optical imaging approach allows us to study the hemodynamic response independently in individual vessels, and in discrete regions of the parenchyma with enough resolution to precisely characterize subtle spatial and temporal features of the response. Specifically, we explore when and where the first hemodynamic changes occur in response to stimuli, the direction and speed at which these changes propagate in arterioles and regions of the parenchyma, and the relative timing at which each of these compartments returns to its original baseline state. From these results, we are able to conclude that the hemodynamic response appears to initiate in the parenchyma and then spreads rapidly to surface arterioles. Following the initial onset we find evidence that the response spreads spatially outwards via the dilation of targeted arterioles. This propagation of vasodilation is independent of the direction of blood flow within each arteriole. We also find evidence of a decay phase that acts with a more uniform spatial dependence, rather than along targeted vessels, causing the periphery of the responding region to return to baseline first. We hypothesize that different underlying cellular mechanisms/signaling pathways are responsible for the response initiation and the response decay. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of the hemodynamic response, as well as our ability to evaluate potential cellular mechanisms for their involvement in neurovascular coupling.},

@article{Dittman1998,
	Abstract = {Short-term depression is a widespread form of use-dependent plasticity found in the peripheral and central nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates. The mechanism behind this transient decrease in synaptic strength is thought to be primarily the result of presynaptic "depletion" of a readily releasable neurotransmitter pool, which typically recovers with a time constant of a few seconds. We studied the mechanism and dynamics of recovery from depression at the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, where marked presynaptic depression has been described previously. Climbing fibers are well suited to studies of recovery from depression because they display little, if any, facilitation (even under conditions of low-release probability), which can obscure rapid recovery from depression for hundreds of milliseconds after release. We found that recovery from depression occurred in three kinetic phases. The fast and intermediate components could be approximated by exponentials with time constants of 100 msec and 3 sec at 24 degrees C. A much slower recovery phase was also present, but it was only prominent during prolonged stimulus trains. The fast component was enhanced by raising extracellular calcium and was eliminated by lowering presynaptic calcium, suggesting that, on short time scales, recovery from depression is driven by residual calcium. During regular and Poisson stimulus trains, recovery from depression was dramatically accelerated by accumulation of presynaptic residual calcium, maintaining synaptic efficacy under conditions that would otherwise deplete the available transmitter pool. This represents a novel form of presynaptic plasticity in that high levels of activity modulate the rate of recovery as well as the magnitude of depression.},

@article{Forrest2014,
	Abstract = {Keywords: sodium-potassium pump, Purkinje cell, neuron model, cerebellum, neural code, Na + /K + pump, Na + /K + -ATPase Brain neurons can transmit signals using a flow of Na + and K + ions, which produce an electrical spike called an action poten-tial (AP) (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952). After an AP, the Na + /K + pump resets the arrangement of Na + and K + ions back to their original positions so that the neuron is then ready to relay another AP when it is called upon to do so (Glitsch, 2001). So, the Na + /K + pump has a " housekeeping " role rather than a direct role in brain sig-naling. This is the long-held, entrenched viewpoint. However, novel research upon cerebellar Purkinje neurons suggests that the Na + /K + pump may have a direct role in brain coding and computation (Forrest, 2008, 2014a,b; Forrest et al., 2009, 2012). This research was conducted in 2006--2007, and presented in a 2008 Ph.D. thesis (Forrest, 2008), but has only been published relatively recently. In the inter-vening period it was serially rejected by reviewers and journals that were uncom-fortable with this re-appraisal of Na + /K + pump function. Purkinje neurons are found in the cerebellum, responsible for motor control (Ito, 1984). The Na + /K + pump uses the energy of one ATP molecule to exchange three intracellular Na + ions for two extracellular K + ions (Glitsch, 2001). Thus, the pump is electrogenic, extruding one net charge per cycle to hyperpolarize the membrane potential. In vitro, the Na + /K + pump has been shown to control and set the intrin-sic activity mode of Purkinje neurons (Forrest, 2008, 2014a; Forrest et al., 2009, 2012). It dictates whether the Purkinje neuron is quiescent or spontaneously fir-ing in a continuous tonic, continuous burst, bimodal (tonic and quiescent), trimodal (tonic, burst, quiescent), or bimodal (burst and quiescent) repeat pat-tern. In the bimodal and trimodal repeat patterns, the Na + /K + pump sets the length of each constituent mode. So, at the foun-dation of the Purkinje cell's intrinsic mul-timodality, there is the working of just a single molecular species: the Na + /K + pump. Numerical modeling of experimental data suggests that, in vivo, the Na + /K + pump produces long quiescent punctu-ations ({\textgreater}{\textgreater}1 s) to Purkinje neuron fir-ing (Forrest, 2014a). The Na + /K + pump is an enzyme and its activity is depen-dent on the concentration of its sub-strates: intracellular Na + and extracellular K + (Glitsch, 2001). Na + flows into and accumulates in the Purkinje cell during fir-ing; Forrest's numerical model proposes that intracellular Na + concentration is a memory element, which records firing his-tory (Forrest, 2014a). Furthermore, that the Na + /K + pump " reads " this memory setting to dictate the timing and dura-tion of long quiescent periods. To spec-ulate, these long quiescent periods, on the scale of seconds and minutes, may be computationally advantageous. By con-ferring an access to longer time scales, they may permit storage and short-term processing of sensory information in the cerebellar cortex. To elaborate, they may permit different dynamical states to be sus-tained in the cerebellar cortex for extended periods. Each of these states is associ-ated with a specific configuration of firing and quiescent states in different Purkinje cells. These network states could store information and perform computations. So, these network computations sit upon the proposed intracellular Na + ion com-putation, mediated by the Na + /K + pump, which dictates the activity state of indi-vidual Purkinje neurons (firing or quies-cent). Forrest terms this hypothesis: " ion to network " computation (Forrest, 2014a). There could be further layers of con-trol and regulation: the Na + /K + pump is a receptor for the endo-ouabain sig-naling molecule (Xie and Cai, 2003) and Na + /K + pump activity might be mod-ulated by intracellular signaling cascades (Therien and Blostein, 2000; Bagrov and Shapiro, 2008). Relevantly, a mutation in the Na + /K + pump causes rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism, which has symp-toms to indicate that it is a pathology of cerebellar computation (Cannon, 2004; de Carvalho et al., 2004). Furthermore, an ouabain block of Na + /K + pumps in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying movement disorders: ataxia and dystonia (Calderon et al., 2011). In recent times, other groups have shown the Na + /K + pump to be a compu-tational element in other neuron types, in other systems. For example, the Na + /K + pump produces an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) to each burst in the motor neu-rons of Drosophilia larvae; AHP amplitude is dependent on the number of spikes in the burst (Glanzman, 2010; Pulver and Griffith, 2010). So the Na + /K + pump gen-erated AHP acts as a spike counter and is a form of short-term memory. Locomotion in Xenopus tadpoles, as in vertebrates generally, is produced by a central pattern generator (CPG) network},

	Abstract = {Application of glutamate to glial cell cultures stimulates the formation and release of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) from arachidonic acid by cytochome P-450 epoxygenases. Epoxygenase inhibitors reduce the cerebral vasodilator response to glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate. We tested the hypothesis that epoxygenase inhibitors reduce the somatosensory cortical blood flow response to whisker activation. In chloralose-anesthetized rats, percent changes in cortical perfusion over whisker barrel cortex were measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry during whisker stimulation. Two pharmacologically distinct inhibitors were superfused subdurally: 1) N-methylsulfonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH), an epoxygenase substrate inhibitor; and 2) miconazole, a reversible cytochrome P-450 inhibitor acting on the heme moiety. Superfusion with 5 micromol/l MS-PPOH decreased the hyperemic response to whisker stimulation by 28{\%} (from 25 +/- 9 to 18 +/- 7{\%}, means +/- SD, n = 8). With 20 micromol/l MS-PPOH superfusion, the response was decreased by 69{\%} (from 28 +/- 9{\%} to 9 +/- 4{\%}, n = 8). Superfusion with 20 micromol/l miconazole decreased the flow response by 67{\%} (from 31 +/- 6{\%} to 10 +/- 3{\%}, n = 8). Subsequent superfusion with vehicle restored the response to 26 +/- 11{\%}. Indomethacin did not prevent MS-PPOH inhibition of the flow response, suggesting that EET-related vasodilation was not dependent solely on cyclooxygenase metabolism of 5,6-EET. Neither MS-PPOH nor miconazole changed baseline flow, reduced the blood flow response to an adenosine A(2) agonist, or decreased somatosensory evoked potentials. The marked reduction of the cortical flow response to whisker stimulation with two different types of epoxygenase inhibitors indicates that EETs play an important role in the physiological coupling of blood flow to neural activation.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid-beta (A beta)-peptides are involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's dementia. We studied the effects of A beta on selected constrictor responses of cerebral circulation. Mice were anesthetized (by using urethane-chloralose) and equipped with a cranial window. Arterial pressure and blood gases were monitored and controlled. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by a laser Doppler probe. Topical superfusion with A beta 1-40 (0.1-10 microM), but not with the reverse peptide A beta 40-1, reduced resting CBF (-29 +/- 4{\%} at 5 microM; P {\textless}0.05) and augmented the reduction in CBF produced by the thromboxane analog U-46619 (+45 +/- 3{\%} at 5 microM; P {\textless}0.05). A beta 1-40 or A beta 1-42 did not affect the reduction in CBF produced by hypocapnia. The reduction in resting CBF and the enhancement of vasoconstriction were reversed by treatment with the free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase or manganic(I-II)meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin. Substitution of the methionine residue in position 35 with norleucine, a mutation that abolishes the ability of A beta to produce free radicals, abolished its vascular effects. Nanomolar concentrations of A beta 1-40 constricted isolated pressurized middle cerebral artery segments with intrinsic tone (-16 +/- 3{\%} at 100 nM; P {\textless}0.05). We conclude that A beta acts directly on cerebral arteries to produce vasoconstriction and to enhance selected constrictor responses. The evidence supports the idea that A beta-induced production of reactive oxygen species plays a role in this effect. The vascular actions of A beta may contribute to the deleterious effects resulting from accumulation of this peptide in Alzheimer's dementia.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in brain imaging techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), offer great promise for noninvasive mapping of brain function. However, the indirect nature of the imaging signals to the underlying neural activity limits the interpretation of the resulting maps. The present report represents the first systematic study with sufficient statistical power to quantitatively characterize the relationship between changes in blood oxygen content and the neural spiking and synaptic activity. Using two-dimensional optical measurements of hemodynamic signals, simultaneous recordings of neural activity, and an event-related stimulus paradigm, we demonstrate that (1) there is a strongly nonlinear relationship between electrophysiological measures of neuronal activity and the hemodynamic response, (2) the hemodynamic response continues to grow beyond the saturation of electrical activity, and (3) the initial increase in deoxyhemoglobin that precedes an increase in blood volume is counterbalanced by an equal initial decrease in oxyhemoglobin.},

Initially we have included full three-dimensional representations of 87 neurons from the hippocampus, obtained following intracellular staining with biocytin and reconstruction using Neurolucida. The archive system includes a structure editor for correcting any departures from valid branching geometry and which allows simple errors in the digitisation to be corrected. The editor employs a platform-independent file format which enforces the constraints that there should be no isolated branches and no closed loops. It also incorporates software for interconversion between the archive format and those used by various neuronal reconstruction and modelling packages. The raw data from digitisation software can be included in the archive as well as edited reconstructions and any further information available. Cross-referenced tables and indexes are updated automatically and are sorted according to a number of fields including the cell type, contributor, submission date and published reference. Both the archive and the structure editor should facilitate the quantitative use of full three-dimensional reconstructions of neurons from the hippocampus and other brain regions.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes exhibit oscillations and waves of Ca2+ ions within their cytosol and it appears that this behavior helps facilitate the astrocyte's interaction with its environment, including its neighboring neurons. Often changes in the oscillatory behavior are initiated by an external stimulus such as glutamate, recently however, it has been observed that oscillations are also initiated spontaneously. We propose here a mathematical model of how spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations arise in astrocytes. This model uses the calcium-induced calcium release and inositol cross-coupling mechanisms coupled with a receptor-independent method for producing inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate as the heart of the model. By computationally mimicking experimental constraints we have found that this model provides results that are qualitatively similar to experiment. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Liu2008,
	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) modulates vasodilation in cerebral cortex during sensory activation. NO is known to inhibit the synthesis of 20-HETE, which has been implicated in arteriolar constriction during astrocyte activation in brain slices. We tested the hypothesis that the attenuated cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to whisker stimulation seen after NO synthase (NOS) inhibition requires 20-HETE synthesis and that the ability of an epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) antagonist to reduce the CBF response is blunted after NOS inhibition but restored with simultaneous blockade of 20-HETE synthesis. In anesthetized rats, the increase in CBF during whisker stimulation was attenuated after the blockade of neuronal NOS with 7-nitroindazole. Subsequent administration of the 20-HETE synthesis inhibitor N-hydroxy-N'-(4-n-butyl-2-methylphenyl)formamidine (HET0016) restored the CBF response to control levels. After the administration of 7-nitroindazole, the inhibitory effect of an EETs antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid (14,15-EEZE) on the CBF response was lost, whereas the simultaneous administration of 7-nitroindazole and HET0016 restored the inhibitory effect of 14,15-EEZE. The administration of HET0016 alone had only a small effect on the evoked CBF response in rats. Furthermore, in neuronal NOS(+/+) and NOS(-/-) mice, HET0016 administration did not increase the CBF response to whisker stimulation. In neuronal NOS(+/+) mice, HET0016 also blocked the reduction in the response seen with acute NOS inhibition. These results indicate that 20-HETE synthesis normally does not substantially restrict functional hyperemia. Increased NO production during functional activation may act dynamically to suppress 20-HETE synthesis or downstream signaling and permit EETs-dependent vasodilation. With the chronic loss of neuronal NOS in mice, other mechanisms apparently suppress 20-HETE synthesis or signaling.},

@article{Haddock2006,
	Abstract = {Control of cerebral vasculature differs from that of systemic vessels outside the blood-brain barrier. The hypothesis that the endothelium modulates vasomotion via direct myoendothelial coupling was investigated in a small vessel of the cerebral circulation. In the primary branch of the rat basilar artery, membrane potential, diameter, and calcium dynamics associated with vasomotion were examined using selective inhibitors of endothelial function in intact and endothelium-denuded arteries. Vessel anatomy, protein, and mRNA expression were studied using conventional electron microscopy high-resolution ultrastructural and confocal immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Membrane potential oscillations were present in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and these preceded rhythmical contractions during which adjacent SMC intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) waves were synchronized. Endothelium removal abolished vasomotion and desynchronized adjacent smooth muscle cell [Ca(2+)](i) waves. N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (10 microM) did not mimic this effect, and dibutyryl cGMP (300 muM) failed to resynchronize [Ca(2+)](i) waves in endothelium-denuded arteries. Combined charybdotoxin and apamin abolished vasomotion and depolarized and constricted vessels, even in absence of endothelium. Separately, (37,43)Gap27 and (40)Gap27 abolished vasomotion. Extensive myoendothelial gap junctions (3 per endothelial cell) composed of connexins 37 and 40 connected the endothelial cell and SMC layers. Synchronized vasomotion in rat basilar artery is endothelium dependent, with [Ca(2+)](i) waves generated within SMCs being coordinated by electrical coupling via myoendothelial gap junctions.},

We present a detailed analysis of the intercellular wave in a two-dimensional sheet of cells. The model is based on the hypothesis that the wave is the result of diffusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from the stimulated cell. The two-dimensional model agrees well with experimental data and makes the following quantitative predictions: as the distance from the stimulated cells increases, 1) the intercellular delay increases exponentially, 2) the intracellular wave speed decreases exponentially, and 3) the arrival time increases exponentially. Furthermore, 4) a proportion of the cells at the periphery of the response will exhibit waves of decreased amplitude, 5) the intercellular membrane permeability to IP3 must be approximately 2 microns/s or greater, and 6) the ratio of the maximum concentration of IP3 in the stimulated cell to the Km of the IP3 receptor (with respect to IP3) must be approximately 300 or greater. These predictions constitute a rigorous test of the hypothesis that the intercellular Ca2+ waves are mediated by IP3 diffusion.},

	Abstract = {The discrepancy between the increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CMRO2 during neural activation causes an increase in venous blood oxygenation and, therefore, a decrease in paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin concentration in venous blood. This can be detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. In the present study, changes in the cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) that corresponds to the ratio of CMRO2 to CBF, and in the BOLD signal during neural activation, were measured by both positron emission tomography (PET) and fMRI in the same human subjects. C15O, 15O2, and H2(15)O PET studies were performed in each subject at rest (baseline) and during performance of a right-hand motor task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies were then performed to measure the BOLD signal under the two conditions. During performance of the motor task, a significant increase in CBF and a significant decrease in OEF were observed in the left precentral gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, right cingulate gyrus, and right cerebellum. A significant positive correlation was observed between changes in the CBF and the BOLD signal, and a significant negative correlation was observed between changes in the OEF and the BOLD signal. This supports the assumption on which BOLD contrast studies during neural activation are based.},

	Abstract = {Experiments were carried out to investigate the functional and anatomical relationships between neuronal elements and cerebral microvessels in 300-350-$\mu$m thick coronal hippocampal slices maintained at 33-35$\,^{\circ}$C, obtained from 150-200 g male Wistar rats. Cerebral arterioles (9-22 $\mu$m in diameter) were visualized in situ and pre-constricted by 22.0 $\pm$ 6.6{\%} by the addition of the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619 (75 nM), to the bathing medium. The glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (0.01-1 mM) produced a dose-related increase in luminal diameter of pre-constricted vessels. In the presence of 4 $\mu$M haemoglobin to scavenge nitric oxide from the extravascular environment of the slice, the increase in diameter evoked by 0.1 mM N- methyl-D-aspartate was significantly reduced from 17.5 $\pm$ 4.6{\%} to 4.8 $\pm$ 1.7{\%} indicating that N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced vasodilatation of cerebral microvessels is mediated via a mechanism which involves neuronally-derived nitric oxide. In a parallel anatomical study, $\beta$-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent diaphorase staining was used to reveal the enzyme nitric oxide synthase in vascular endothelium and neurons in slices. A small subpopulation ({\textless} 11 cells per slice) of darkly-stained multipolar neurons, 21-32 $\mu$m in diameter was observed to give rise to a dense network of fine diaphorase-reactive nerve fibres that ramified throughout the whole of the hippocampus and appeared to come into close apposition with arterioles. Morphometric analysis of the relationship between cerebral microvessels, $\beta$-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form- dependent diaphorase-reactive neuronal elements and individual pyramidal layer neurons, identified by filling with biocytin, revealed that for a given point on a pyramidal layer neuron, the proximity of the nearest diaphorase- reactive nerve fibre was less than 10 $\mu$m, whilst the distance to the nearest arteriole (the smallest functional unit for controlling blood flow) was in excess of 70 $\mu$m. Such a distance would probably preclude diffusion of vasoactive metabolites in effective concentrations from the area of increased neuronal activity. We therefore propose that the diaphorase-reactive nerve network constitutes the functional link. It is possible that during periods of increased neuronal activity, spillover of glutamate from synapses may activate the diaphorase-reactive network. Release of nitric oxide from the network in the vicinity of local cerebral arterioles may then produce relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle, enabling increased blood flow into the capillary network supplying the region of increased metabolic activity. This study has shown that the process whereby increases in neuronal activity elicit a local change in cerebral blood flow remains functionally intact in hippocampal slice preparations. Nitric oxide of neuronal origin appears to be involved in mediating the coupling between neurons and cerebral arterioles. Stereological analysis of the relationship between neuronal and vascular elements within hippocampal slices suggested that a small subpopulation of nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons which give rise to a diffuse network of fine nitric oxide synthase-containing nerve fibres that lie in close apposition to cerebral arterioles may provide the anatomical substrate for coupling of blood flow to metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by vascular endothelial cells is a potent vasodilator and an antiinflammatory mediator. Regulating production of endothelial-derived NO is a complex undertaking, involving multiple signaling and genetic pathways that are activated by diverse humoral and biomechanical stimuli. To gain a thorough understanding of the rich diversity of responses observed experimentally, it is necessary to account for an ensemble of these pathways acting simultaneously. In this article, we have assembled four quantitative molecular pathways previously proposed for shear-stress-induced NO production. In these pathways, endothelial NO synthase is activated 1), via calcium release, 2), via phosphorylation reactions, and 3), via enhanced protein expression. To these activation pathways, we have added a fourth, a pathway describing actual NO production from endothelial NO synthase and its various protein partners. These pathways were combined and simulated using CytoSolve, a computational environment for combining independent pathway calculations. The integrated model is able to describe the experimentally observed change in NO production with time after the application of fluid shear stress. This model can also be used to predict the specific effects on the system after interventional pharmacological or genetic changes. Importantly, this model reflects the up-to-date understanding of the NO system, providing a platform upon which information can be aggregated in an additive way. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {In the CNS, astrocytes are sensory and regulatory hubs that play important roles in cerebral homeostatic processes, including matching local cerebral blood flow to neuronal metabolism (neurovascular coupling). These cells possess a highly branched network of processes that project from the soma to neuronal synapses as well as to arterioles and capillaries, where they terminate in "endfeet" that encase the blood vessels. Ca(2+) signaling within the endfoot mediates neurovascular coupling; thus, these functional microdomains control vascular tone and local perfusion in the brain. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels--nonselective cation channels with considerable Ca(2+) conductance--have been identified in astrocytes, but their function is largely unknown. We sought to characterize the influence of TRPV4 channels on Ca(2+) dynamics in the astrocytic endfoot microdomain and assess their role in neurovascular coupling. We identified local TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) oscillations in endfeet and further found that TRPV4 Ca(2+) signals are amplified and propagated by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release from inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Moreover, TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) influx contributes to the endfoot Ca(2+) response to neuronal activation, enhancing the accompanying vasodilation. Our results identify a dynamic synergy between TRPV4 channels and IP3Rs in astrocyte endfeet and demonstrate that TRPV4 channels are engaged in and contribute to neurovascular coupling.},

	Abstract = {1. A new form of synaptic depression of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed when making voltage-clamp recordings from large presynaptic terminals, the calyces of Held and postsynaptic cells, the principal cells of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), in slices of the rat auditory brainstem. 2. A short (100 ms) depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to 0 mV reduced the amplitude of the EPSCs by 35 +/- 5 {\%} (n = 7), measured at 10 ms following the depolarization. Recovery occurred within 0.5 s. 3. The reduction of the EPSCs was most probably due to reduced presynaptic calcium influx, since postsynaptic depolarization reduced presynaptic calcium or barium currents. Conversely, presynaptic depolarization also reduced postsynaptic calcium or barium influx, under conditions where transmitter release was minimal. 4. The calcium currents and the postsynaptic depolarization-induced suppression of synaptic transmission recovered with a similar time course, suggesting that this form of synaptic depression was, most probably, due to depletion of Ca2+ in the synaptic cleft. 5. We conclude that when the Ca2+ influx into the pre- or postsynaptic cell is large, extracellular Ca2+ is depleted. Under these conditions, the Ca2+ concentration in the synaptic cleft is a sensitive indicator of the level of synaptic activity. However, the synaptic cleft is less sensitive to Ca2+ depletion than predicted from its estimated volume.},

	Abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) evokes the conduction of vasodilation along resistance microvessels. However, it is not known which cell layer (endothelium or smooth muscle) serves as the conduction pathway. In isolated, cannulated feed arteries ( approximately 70 microm in diameter at 75 mm Hg; length approximately 4 mm) of the hamster retractor muscle, we tested the hypothesis that endothelial cells provide the pathway for conduction. Microiontophoresis of ACh (500 ms, 500 nA) onto the distal end of a feed artery evoked hyperpolarization (-13+/-2 mV) of both cell layers with vasodilation (15+/-1 microm) along the entire vessel. To selectively damage endothelial cells (confirmed by loss of vasodilation to ACh and labeling of disrupted cells with propidium iodide), an air bubble was perfused through a portion of the vessel lumen, or a 70-kDa fluorescein-conjugated dextran (FCD) was illuminated within a segment (300 microm) of the lumen. After endothelial cell damage, hyperpolarization and vasodilation conducted up to, but not through, the treated segment. To selectively damage smooth muscle cells (confirmed by loss of vasoconstriction to phenylephrine and labeling with propidium iodide), FCD was perifused around the vessel and illuminated. Vasodilation and hyperpolarization conducted past the disrupted smooth muscle cells without attenuation. We conclude that endothelial cells provide the pathway for conducting hyperpolarization and vasodilation along feed arteries in response to ACh.},

	Abstract = {The cellular events that cause ischemic neurological damage following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have remained elusive. We report that subarachnoid blood profoundly impacts communication within the neurovascular unit-neurons, astrocytes, and arterioles-causing inversion of neurovascular coupling. Elevation of astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) to ∼400 nM by neuronal stimulation or to ∼300 nM by Ca(2+) uncaging dilated parenchymal arterioles in control brain slices but caused vasoconstriction in post-SAH brain slices. Inhibition of K(+) efflux via astrocytic endfoot large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels prevented both neurally evoked vasodilation (control) and vasoconstriction (SAH). Consistent with the dual vasodilator/vasoconstrictor action of extracellular K(+) ([K(+)](o)), [K(+)](o) {\textless}10 mM dilated and [K(+)](o) {\textgreater}20 mM constricted isolated brain cortex parenchymal arterioles with or without SAH. Notably, elevation of external K(+) to 10 mM caused vasodilation in brain slices from control animals but caused a modest constriction in brain slices from SAH model rats; this latter effect was reversed by BK channel inhibition, which restored K(+)-induced dilations. Importantly, the amplitude of spontaneous astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations was increased after SAH, with peak Ca(2+) reaching ∼490 nM. Our data support a model in which SAH increases the amplitude of spontaneous astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations sufficiently to activate endfoot BK channels and elevate [K(+)](o) in the restricted perivascular space. Abnormally elevated basal [K(+)](o) combined with further K(+) efflux stimulated by neuronal activity elevates [K(+)](o) above the dilation/constriction threshold, switching the polarity of arteriolar responses to vasoconstriction. Inversion of neurovascular coupling may contribute to the decreased cerebral blood flow and development of neurological deficits that commonly follow SAH.},

@article{Dermietzel1991,
	Abstract = {The properties of astroglial gap junction channels and the protein that constitutes the channels were characterized by immunocytochemical, molecular biological, and physiological techniques. Comparative immunocytochemical labeling utilizing different antibodies specific for liver connexin 32 and connexin 26 and antibodies to peptides corresponding to carboxy-terminal sequences of the heart gap junction protein (connexin 43) indicates that the predominant gap junction protein in astrocytes is connexin 43. The expression of this connexin in cultured astrocytes was also established by Western and Northern blot analyses. Cultured astrocytes expressed connexin 43 mRNA and did not contain detectable levels of the mRNAs encoding connexin 32 or connexin 26. Further, the cells contained the same primary connexin 43 translation product and the same phosphorylated forms as heart. Finally, electrophysiological recordings under voltage-clamp conditions revealed that astrocyte cell pairs were moderately well coupled, with an average junctional conductance of about 13 nS. Single-channel recordings indicated a unitary junctional conductance of about 50-60 pS, which is of the same order as that found in cultured rat cardiac myocytes, where the channel properties of connexin 43 were first described. Thus, physiological properties of gap junction channels appear to be determined by the connexin expressed, independent of the tissue type.},

	Abstract = {This article investigates the relation between stimulus-evoked neural activity and cerebral hemodynamics. Specifically, the hypothesis is tested that hemodynamic responses can be modeled as a linear convolution of experimentally obtained measures of neural activity with a suitable hemodynamic impulse response function. To obtain a range of neural and hemodynamic responses, rat whisker pad was stimulated using brief ({\textless}/=2 seconds) electrical stimuli consisting of single pulses (0.3 millisecond, 1.2 mA) combined both at different frequencies and in a paired-pulse design. Hemodynamic responses were measured using concurrent optical imaging spectroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry, whereas neural responses were assessed through current source density analysis of multielectrode recordings from a single barrel. General linear modeling was used to deconvolve the hemodynamic impulse response to a single "neural event" from the hemodynamic and neural responses to stimulation. The model provided an excellent fit to the empirical data. The implications of these results for modeling schemes and for physiologic systems coupling neural and hemodynamic activity are discussed.},

Cells at three key interfaces form barriers between the blood and the CNS: the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-CSF barrier and the arachnoid barrier. The BBB at the level of brain microvessel endothelium is the major site of blood-CNS exchange. The structure and function of the BBB is summarised, the physical barrier formed by the endothelial tight junctions, and the transport barrier resulting from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms. The roles of associated cells are outlined, especially the endfeet of astrocytic glial cells, and pericytes and microglia. The embryonic development of the BBB, and changes in pathology are described. The BBB is subject to short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology. Any programme for drug discovery or delivery, to target or avoid the CNS, needs to consider the special features of the BBB.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are characterized by a very negative resting potential and a high resting permeability for K(+) ions. Early pharmacological and biophysical studies suggested that the resting potential is established by the activity of inwardly rectifying, Ba(2+) sensitive, weakly rectifying Kir channels. Molecular cloning has identified 16 Kir channels genes of which several mRNA transcripts and protein products have been identified in glial cells. However, genetic deletion and siRNA knock-down studies suggest that the resting conductance of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is largely due to Kir4.1. Loss of Kir4.1 causes membrane depolarization, and a break-down of K(+) and glutamate homeostasis which results in seizures and wide-spread white matter pathology. Kir channels have also been shown to act as critical regulators of cell division whereby Kir function is correlated with an exit from the cell cycle. Conversely, loss of functional Kir channels is associated with re-entry of cells into the cell cycle and gliosis. A loss of functional Kir channels has been shown in a number of neurological diseases including temporal lobe epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, retinal degeneration and malignant gliomas. In the latter, expression of Kir4.1 is sufficient to arrest the aberrant growth of these glial derived tumor cells. Kir4.1 therefore represents a potential therapeutic target in a wide variety of neurological conditions.},

@article{Rosenegger2015,
	Abstract = {According to the current model of neurovascular coupling, blood flow is controlled regionally through phasic changes in the activity of neurons and astrocytes that signal to alter arteriole diameter. Absent in this model, however, is how brain blood flow is tonically regulated independent of regional changes in activity. This is important because a large fraction of brain blood flow is required to maintain basal metabolic needs. Using two-photon fluorescence imaging combined with patch-clamp in acute rat brain slices of sensory-motor cortex, we demonstrate that reducing resting Ca2+ in astrocytes with intracellular BAPTA causes vasoconstriction in adjacent arterioles. BAPTA-induced vasoconstriction was eliminated by a general COX blocker and the effect is mimicked by a COX-1, but not COX-2, antagonist, suggesting that astrocytes provide tonic, steady-state vasodilation by releasing prostaglandin messengers. Tonic vasodilation was insensitive to TTX, as well as a variety of synaptic and extrasynaptic receptor antagonists, indicating that the phenomenon operates largely independent of neural activity. Using in vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging of the barrel cortex in fully awake mice, we reveal that acute COX-1 inhibition reduces resting arteriole diameter but fails to affect vasodilation in response to vibrissae stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that astrocytes provide tonic regulation of arterioles using resting intracellular Ca2+ in a manner that is independent of phasic, neuronal-evoked vasodilation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The brain requires both phasic and tonic regulation of its blood supply to service energy needs over various temporal windows. While many mechanisms have been described for phasic blood flow regulation, how the brain accomplishes tonic control is largely unknown. Here we describe a way in which astrocytes contribute to the management of basal brain blood flow by providing steady-state vasodilation to arterioles via resting astrocyte Ca2+ and the continuous release of prostaglandin messengers. This phenomenon may be important for understanding the declines in basal brain blood flow that occur in aging and dementia, as well as for the interpretation of fMRI data.},

	Abstract = {During a period of acute ischemia in vivo or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro, CA1 neurons depolarize, swell and become overloaded with calcium. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that the initial responses to OGD are at least partly due to transient receptor potential (TRP) channel activation. As some TRP channels are temperature-sensitive, we also compared the effects of pharmacological blockade of the channels with the effects of reducing temperature. Acute hippocampal slices (350 ??m) obtained from Wistar rats were submerged in ACSF at 36??C. CA1 neurons were monitored electrophysiologically using extracellular, intracellular or whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Cell swelling was assessed by recording changes in relative tissue resistance, and changes in intracellular calcium were measured after loading neurons with fura-2 dextran. Blockers of TRP channels (ruthenium red, La3+, Gd3+, 2-APB) or lowering temperature by 3??C reduced responses to OGD. This included: (a) an increased delay to negative shifts of extracellular DC potential; (b) reduction in rate of the initial slow membrane depolarization, slower development of OGD-induced increase in cell input resistance and slower development of whole-cell inward current; (c) reduced tissue swelling; and (d) a smaller rise in intracellular calcium. Mild hypothermia (33??C) and La3+ or Gd3+ (100 ??M) showed an occlusion effect when delay to extracellular DC shifts was measured. Expression of TRPM2/TRPM7 (oxidative stress-sensitive) and TRPV3/TRPV4 (temperature-sensitive) channels was demonstrated in the CA1 subfield with RT-PCR. These results indicate that TRP or TRP-like channels are activated by cellular stress and contribute to ischemia-induced membrane depolarization, intracellular calcium accumulation and cell swelling. We also hypothesize that closing of some TRP channels (TRPV3 and/or TRPV4) by lowering temperature may be partly responsible for the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, high potassium media (30 mM) constricted the afferent arteriole in the presence of gadolinium. 3.

@article{Cox2014,
	Abstract = {BKCa-channel activity often affects the firing properties of neurons, the shapes of neuronal action potentials (APs), and in some cases the extent of neurotransmitter release. It has become clear that BKCa channels often form complexes with voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV channels) such that when a CaV channel is activated, the ensuing influx of Ca2+ activates its closely associated BKCa channel. Thus, in modeling the electrical properties of neurons, it would be useful to have quantitative models of CaV/BKCa complexes. Furthermore, in a population of CaV/BKCa complexes, all BKCa channels are not exposed to the same Ca2+ concentration at the same time. Thus, stochastic rather than deterministic models are required. To date, however, no such models have been described. Here, however, I present a stochastic model of a CaV2.1/BKCa(??-only) complex, as might be found in a central nerve terminal. The CaV2.1/BKCa model is based on kinetic modeling of its two component channels at physiological temperature. Surprisingly, The CaV2.1/BKCa model predicts that although the CaV channel will open nearly every time during a typical cortical AP, its associated BKCa channel is expected to open in only 30{\%} of trials, and this percentage is very sensitive to the duration of the AP, the distance between the two channels in the complex, and the presence of fast internal Ca2+ buffers. Also, the model predicts that the kinetics of the BKCa currents of a population of CaV2.1/BKCa complexes will not be limited by the kinetics of the CaV2.1 channel, and during a train of APs, the current response of the complex is expected to faithfully follow even very rapid trains. Aside from providing insight into how these complexes are likely to behave in vivo, the models presented here could also be of use more generally as components of higher-level models of neural function.},

	Abstract = {The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured in the brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an activation experiment often exhibits pronounced transients at the beginning and end of the stimulus. Such transients could be a reflection of transients in the underlying neural activity, or they could result from transients in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), or cerebral blood volume (CBV). These transients were investigated using an arterial spin labeling (ASL) method that allows simultaneous measurements of BOLD and CBF responses. Responses to a finger-tapping task (40-s stimulus, 80-s rest) were measured in primary motor area (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in five healthy volunteers. In SMA, the average BOLD response was pronounced near the beginning and end of the stimulus, while in M1, the BOLD response was nearly flat. However, CBF responses in the two regions were rather similar, and did not exhibit the same transient features as the BOLD response in SMA. Because this suggests a hemodynamic rather than a neural origin for the transients of the BOLD response in SMA, we used a generalization of the balloon model to test the degree of hemodynamic transients required to produce the measured curves. Both data sets could be approximated with modest differences in the shapes of the CMRO2 and CBV responses. This study illustrates the utility and the limitations of using theoretical models combined with ASL techniques to understand the dynamics of the BOLD response. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Computational modeling is challenged by the fact that many details remain hitherto unknown and conventional approaches to describe synaptic function are unsuitable to explain experimental observations when astrocytic signaling is taken into account. Supported by experimental evidence is the possibility that astrocytes perform genuine information processing by means of their calcium signaling and are players in the physiological setting of the basal tone of synaptic transmission. Here we consider the plausibility of this scenario from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the modulation of synaptic release probability by the astrocyte and its implications on synaptic plasticity. The analysis of the signaling pathways underlying such modulation refines our notion of tripartite synapse and has profound implications on our understanding of brain function.},

Together, these cells orchestrate the inflammation and immunopathogenesis underlying the MS autoimmune disease processes and all up-regulate the same voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel, Kv1.3, when fully activated. Only microglia, which mediate central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory processes (possibly playing a dual role of CNS protection and mediation of neuroinflammation/ neurodegeneration), and DC, which are pivotal to the induction of T cell responses, express the distinct Kv1.5 prior to Kv1.3 upregulation. Although the precise functional roles of first Kv1.5 and then Kv1.3 channels are unclear, their differential expression is likely a common mechanism used by both microglia and DC, revealing Kv1.5 (in addition to Kv1.3) as a potentially important target for the development of new immunomodulatory therapies in MS.},

	Abstract = {The vascular response to changes in oxygen levels in the blood and tissue is a highly adaptive physiological response that functions to match tissue oxygen supply to metabolic demand. Defining the cellular mechanisms that can sense physiologically relevant changes in PO2 and adjust vascular diameter are vital to our understanding of this process. A cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme of the 4A family of omega-hydroxylases was localized in renal microvessels, renal cortex, and a striated muscle microvascular bed (cremaster) of the rat. In the presence of molecular oxygen, this P450 enzyme catalyzes formation of 20-HETE from arachidonic acid (AA). Prior studies have shown that 20-HETE potently contracts renal and cerebral arteries and arterioles. The present study demonstrates that 20-HETE constricts striated muscle arterioles as well. In both intact renal microvessels and enriched renal cortical microsomal enzyme preparations, the formation of 20-HETE was linearly dependent on PO2 between 20 and 140 mm Hg. Homogenates of cremaster tissue produced 20-oxygen HETE when incubated with AA. They also expressed message for P450 4A enzyme, as determined by Southern and Western blots. Administration of 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA), which is a P450 4A inhibitor, attenuated the constriction of third-order cremasteric arterioles in response to elevation of superfusion solution PO2 from approximately equal to 3 to 5 mm Hg to approximately equal to 35 mm Hg. 17-ODYA had no effect on basal vascular tone or response of cremaster arterioles to vasoactive compounds. These results demonstrate the existence of P450 omega-hydroxylase activity and 20-HETE formation in the vasculature and parenchyma of at least two microvascular beds. Our data suggest that a P450 enzyme of the 4A family has the potential to function as an oxygen sensor in mammalian microcirculatory beds and to regulate arteriolar caliber by generating 20-HETE in an oxygen-dependent manner.},

	Abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These parts have been grouped in at least five different ways corresponding to five different theories about its basic plan or architecture. Two classical models that remain popular today are derived from (1) comparative anatomy and the body's segmental organization, and (2) comparative embryology and the neural tube's transverse and longitudinal organization. A new approach is concerned with deciphering the genetic program that assembles the nervous system during embryogenesis; how it will correspond to the other models remains to be determined. The simplest current model to explain the organization of the mammalian nervous system involves a segmental trunk that mediates reflex sensory-motor functions, and suprasegmental cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum.},

	Abstract = {Unloading of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores activates influx of extracellular Ca(2+) through 'store-operated' Ca(2+) channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane (PM) of most cells, including astrocytes. A key unresolved issue concerning SOC function is their spatial relationship to ER Ca(2+) stores. Here, using high resolution imaging with the membrane-associated Ca(2+) indicator, FFP-18, it is shown that store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) in primary cultured mouse cortical astrocytes occurs at plasma membrane-ER junctions. In the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), depletion of ER Ca(2+) stores using cyclopiazonic acid, an ER Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, and caffeine transiently increases the sub-plasma-membrane Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](SPM)) within a restricted space between the plasma membrane and adjacent ER. Restoration of extracellular Ca(2+) causes localized Ca(2+) influx that first increases [Ca(2+)](SPM) in the same restricted regions and then, with a delay, in ER-free regions. Antisense knockdown of the TRPC1 gene, proposed to encode endogenous SOCs, markedly reduces SOCE measured with Fura-2. High resolution immunocytochemistry with anti-TRPC1 antibody reveals that these TRPC-encoded SOCs are confined to the PM microdomains adjacent to the underlying 'junctional' ER. Thus, Ca(2+) entry through TRPC-encoded SOCs is closely linked, not only functionally, but also structurally, to the ER Ca(2+) stores.},

	Abstract = {Equilibrium dialysis measurements of the binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin have confirmed the existence of four high affinity Ca2+-binding sites (Kd between 3 X 10(-6) and 2 X 10(-5) M). In the presence of 3 mM Mg2+, the dissociation constants for Ca2+ are increased two- to fourfold (Kd between 5 X 10(-6) and 4 X 10(-5) M). Positive cooperativity of Ca2+ binding was observed at low Ca2+ concentrations with Hill coefficients of 1.33 and 1.22 in the absence and presence of 3 mM Mg2+, respectively. The positive cooperativity is compatible with the steepness of the Ca2+ dependence of the conformational transition associated with the binding of 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of calmodulin. This conformational change, which affects the environment of the aromatic residues of calmodulin as measured by UV absorption and near-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, is not the result of a monomer-dimer equilibrium mediated by Ca2+. Binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin is believed to occur by a sequential mechanism generating at least four different conformers of the protein and its free and liganded states. Even though the major conformational change is almost complete upon binding of 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of calmodulin, the activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase measured in the presence of limiting concentrations of calmodulin suggests that a calmodulin Ca3-42+ complex is required for interaction of calmodulin with the enzyme. As expected, on the basis of the strong affinity of the enzyme for the calmodulin x Ca2+ complex (Kd = 1-3 X 10(-9) M), the Ca2+ dependence of phosphodiesterase activation is highly cooperative and leads to a sharp threshold of Ca2+ concentration for control of enzyme activity.},

	Abstract = {NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated cation channels with high calcium permeability that play important roles in many aspects of the biology of higher organisms. They are critical for the development of the central nervous system (CNS), generation of rhythms for breathing and locomotion, and the processes underlying learning, memory, and neuroplasticity. Consequently, abnormal expression levels and altered NMDAR function have been implicated in numerous neurological disorders and pathological conditions. NMDAR hypofunction can result in cognitive defects, whereas overstimulation causes excitotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration. Therefore, NMDARs are important therapeutic targets for many CNS disorders [1-8] including stroke, hypoxia, ischemia, head trauma, Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, alcoholism, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. To date, drugs targeting NMDARs have had only limited success clinically due to poor efficacy and unacceptable side effects, including hallucinations, catatonia, ataxia, nightmares, and memory deficits. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying agonist-induced receptor activation would facilitate development of more selective drugs that target specific NMDAR subtypes and alter their function to a well-defined extent. This chapter will investigate the physiological roles NMDARs play in the mammalian nervous system and the molecular and structural basis of NMDAR activation. One of the main questions that will be addressed is how agonist binding results in opening of the NMDAR ion channel. Although the mechanism coupling ligand binding to channel opening remains incompletely understood for NMDARs, we propose that this process suggests promising approaches to drug design.},

The resulting "BVP model" has two variables of state, representing excitability and refractoriness, and qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical model for the iron wire model of nerve. This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a "physiological state diagram," with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes were the original neuroglia of Ram{\'{o}}n y Cajal but after 100 years there is no satisfactory definition of what should comprise this class of cells. This essay takes a historical and philosophical approach to the question of astrocytic identity. The classic approach of identification by morphology and location are too limited to determine new members of the astrocyte population. I also critically evaluate the use of protein markers measured by immunoreactivity, as well as the newer technique of marking living cells by using promoters for these same proteins to drive reporter genes. These two latter approaches have yielded an expanded population of astrocytes with diverse functions, but also mark cells that traditionally would not be defined as astrocytes. Thus we need a combination of measures to define an astrocyte but it is not clear what this combination should be. The molecular approach, especially promoter driven fluorescent reporter genes, does have the advantage of pre marking living astrocytes for electrophysiological or imaging recordings. However, lack of sufficient understanding of the behavior of the inserted constructs has led to unclear results. This approach will no doubt be perfected with time but at present an acceptable, practical definition of what constitutes the class of astrocytes remains elusive.},

	Abstract = {The most fundamental aspect of the cerebral circulation is the well-described coupling of cerebral metabolic activity and cerebral blood flow. A number of substances have been proposed to link flow and metabolism, including K+, pH and adenosine. In the ??-chloralose anaesthetised cat we studied simultaneuously cerebral neuronal activity and local blood flow to attempt to dissociate the two and thus determine the coupling substance. Neuronal activity was determined by monitoring unit firing in the parietal cortex with tungsten in glass microelectrodes while local cerebral blood flow in the same area was monitored continuously using laser Doppler flowmetry. To initiate an increase in metabolic activity and, pari passu, blood flow spreading depression was elicited by needle stick injury. Spreading depression when initiated causes a wave of depolarization, measured as an increased firing rate and associated marked (400??95{\%}) increase in local cerebral blood flow. Intravenous administration of NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, produced a complete blockade of the hyperemia associated with spreading depression but no change in either resting cell firing or spreading depression-evoked increases in firing rate. These data demonstrate at least for spreading depression-elicited increases in metabolic activity, that nitric oxide (NO) is a key coupling compound that links changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. These data imply that NO may have a more general role in flow/metabolism coupling and further studies in other situations are required to determine the extent to which NO is responsible for this fundamental cerebrovascular phenomenon. ?? 1992.},

@article{Fujikawa1996,
	Abstract = {It is well known that high potassium (K
+) solutions introduced by microdialysis into normal brain increase the extracellular concentration of the excitatory amino acid glutamate, and in vitro studies suggest that a high exogenously applied glutamate concentration can produce excitotoxic neuronal death. However, only recently were in vivo studies undertaken to determine whether high-K
+ exposure damages neurons. We implanted microdialysis probes into rat amygdalae bilaterally, and after 2-h baseline period exposed one side to a modified Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate solution containing 100 mmol/l KCl for 30, 50 and 70 min, followed by a 2-h recovery period, and 70 min and 3 h without a recovery period. Of 100.9 � 2.0 mmol/l KCl, 12.0 � 1.0{\%} was extracted by amygdalar tissue in vivo. Elevation of the extracellular K
+ concentration in the amygdala for 70 min or longer without a recovery period produced extensive neuronal damage and edematous-appearing neuropil in the tissue dialysed, as well as loss of normal neurons. Histological evidence of edema subsided in the groups with a 2-h recovery period. Although the number of damaged neurons was not significantly higher in the group with a 70 min high-K
+ exposure and 2-h recovery period, the number of normal neurons was reduced, suggesting cell loss. During 70-min high-K
+ exposure, the extracellular glutamate concentration increased to 242-377{\%} of baseline during the first 60 min, and extracellular aspartate rose to 162-213{\%} during the first 50 min; extracellular taurine rose even higher, to 316-567{\%} of baseline, and glutamate fell to 14-27{\%} of baseline. Extracellular serine was decreased at 20, 50 and 70 min of high-K
+ exposure; extracellular glycine was unchanged. The elevated extracellular glutamate and aspartate concentrations suggest that exposure of the amygdala to high extracellular K
+ may produce cell death through an excitotoxic process, and point the way to future studies to define the specific mechanisms involved.},

	Abstract = {Calcium-dependent release of vasoactive gliotransmitters is widely assumed to trigger vasodilation associated with rapid increases in neuronal activity. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, intact stimulus-induced vasodilation was observed in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) type-2 receptor (R2) knock-out (KO) mice, in which the primary mechanism of astrocytic calcium increase-the release of calcium from intracellular stores following activation of an IP3-dependent pathway-is lacking. Further, our results in wild-type (WT) mice indicate that in vivo onset of astrocytic calcium increase in response to sensory stimulus could be considerably delayed relative to the simultaneously measured onset of arteriolar dilation. Delayed calcium increases in WT mice were observed in both astrocytic cell bodies and perivascular endfeet. Thus, astrocytes may not play a role in the initiation of blood flow response, at least not via calcium-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, an increase in astrocytic intracellular calcium was not required for normal vasodilation in the IP3R2-KO animals.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is a fundamental determinant of cardiovascular homesotasis: it regulates systemic blood pressure, vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. Physiologically, the most important stimulus for the continuous formation of NO is the viscous drag (shear stress) generated by the streaming blood on the endothelial layer. Although shear-stress-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS is thought to regulate enzyme activity, the mechanism of activation of eNOS is not yet known. Here we demonstrate that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB mediates the activation of eNOS, leading to increased NO production. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt pathway or mutation of the Akt site on eNOS protein (at serine 1177) attenuates the serine phosphorylation and prevents the activation of eNOS. Mimicking the phosphorylation of Ser 1177 directly enhances enzyme activity and alters the sensitivity of the enzyme to Ca2+, rendering its activity maximal at sub-physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Thus, phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt represents a novel Ca2+-independent regulatory mechanism for activation of eNOS.},

	Abstract = {Neurovascular coupling is the well-documented link between neural stimulation and constriction or dilation of the surrounding vasculature. Glial cells mediate this response via their unique anatomy, which connects neurons to arterioles. It is believed that calcium transients and the release of secondary messengers by these cells influence the vascular response. We present a model of intracellular calcium dynamics in an astrocyte (glial cell) and show that stable oscillatory behaviour is possible under certain conditions. We then couple this to a novel model for the relationship between calcium concentration and the production of vasoactive secondary messengers through a fatty-acid intermediate. The two secondary messengers modelled are epoxyeicosatrienoic and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EET and 20-HETE, respectively). These secondary messengers are produced on different time scales, and we show how this supports the observation that the vasculature dilates rapidly in response to neural stimulation, before returning to baseline levels on a slower time scale.},

	Abstract = {Thrombin has been found in neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, traumatic brain injury, where neurons are exposed to high thrombin levels, is associated with an increased incidence of AD. Our objective was to determine the effects of thrombin administered in vivo on cognitive function and neuropathology. Rats were trained using a radial eight-arm maze and then thrombin (25 or 100 nM, 0.25 microl/h, 28 days) or vehicle was delivered via intracerebroventricular infusion. Animals that received 100 nM thrombin demonstrated cognitive impairments including deficits in reference memory and an increase in task latency. Also, significant neuropathology was detected in these animals such as enlargement of cerebral ventricles, an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, astrogliosis, and an increase in the immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament, and apolipoprotein-E fragments. Thrombin-induced changes in cognitive function and ventricular enlargement were inhibited by hirudin. These findings demonstrate that thrombin is a mediator of neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and suggest that inhibition of thrombin may be a treatment strategy for AD- or head trauma-associated cognitive deficits.},

Altered activities of these substances in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, aging, postmenopausal status, smoking, and infections) appear to underlie the atherosclerotic process. There is increasing evidence from both preclinical studies and clinical trials that nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of arteriosclerosis.

Paradoxically, this communication may cause vasoconstriction in some cases. Here, we show that, regardless of the mechanism by which astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) was elevated, modest increases in Ca(2+) induced dilation, whereas larger increases switched dilation to constriction. Large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive potassium channels in astrocytic endfeet mediated a majority of the dilation and the entire vasoconstriction, implicating local extracellular K(+) as a vasoactive signal for both dilation and constriction. These results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism that explains the nature and apparent duality of the vascular response, showing that the degree and polarity of neurovascular coupling depends on astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) and perivascular K(+).},

@article{Behringer2012,
	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Electrical conduction through gap junction channels between endothelial cells of resistance vessels is integral to blood flow control. Small and intermediate-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (SK(Ca)/IK(Ca)) initiate electrical signals in endothelial cells, but it is unknown whether SK(Ca)/IK(Ca) activation alters signal transmission along the endothelium.

OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that SK(Ca)/IK(Ca) activity regulates electrical conduction along the endothelium of resistance vessels.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Freshly isolated endothelial cell tubes (60 {\$}\mu{\$}m wide; 1-3 mm long; cell length, ≈35 {\$}\mu{\$}m) from mouse skeletal muscle feed (superior epigastric) arteries were studied using dual intracellular microelectrodes. Current was injected ($\pm$0.1-3 nA) at site 1 while recording membrane potential (V(m)) at site 2 (separation distance=50-2000 {\$}\mu{\$}m). SK(Ca)/IK(Ca) activation (NS309, 1 {\$}\mu{\$}mol/L) reduced the change in V(m) along endothelial cell tubes by ≥50{\%} and shortened the electrical length constant ({\$}\lambda{\$}) from 1380 to 850 {\$}\mu{\$}m (P{\textless}0.05) while intercellular dye transfer (propidium iodide) was maintained. Activating SK(Ca)/IK(Ca) with acetylcholine or SKA-31 also reduced electrical conduction. These effects of SK(Ca)/IK(Ca) activation persisted when hyperpolarization ({\textgreater}30 mV) was prevented with 60 mmol/L [K(+)](o). Conversely, blocking SK(Ca)/IK(Ca) (apamin+charybdotoxin) depolarized cells by ≈10 mV and enhanced electrical conduction (ie, changes in V(m)) by ≈30{\%} (P{\textless}0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate a novel role for SK(Ca)/IK(Ca) activity in tuning electrical conduction along the endothelium of resistance vessels by governing signal dissipation through changes in membrane resistance. Voltage-insensitive ion channels can thereby tune intercellular electrical signaling independent from gap junction channels.},

	Abstract = {The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only partially understood. {\$}\beta{\$}-amyloid (A{\$}\beta{\$}) is physiologically generated by sequential cleavage of its precursor protein by the {\$}\beta{\$}- and the {\$}\gamma{\$}-secretase and it is normally disposed of. In Alzheimer's disease, A{\$}\beta{\$} is excessively produced or less dismissed, but the hypothesis on its physiological and pathological role are heterogeneous and often discordant. It has been described a positive feedback loop from the {\$}\gamma{\$}- to the {\$}\beta{\$}-secretase cleavages of A{\$}\beta{\$} precursor protein, which is activated by mutations of Presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic core of the {\$}\gamma{\$}-secretase. These findings show that A{\$}\beta{\$} precursor protein as well the activity of the {\$}\gamma{\$}-secretase are required to obtain the up-regulation of {\$}\beta{\$}-secretase which is induced by Presenilin 1 mutations. Then, A{\$}\beta{\$} 1-42 is the A{\$}\beta{\$} precursor protein derivative that up-regulates the expression of {\$}\beta{\$}-secretase, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun and ERK1/2 are involved. Here, we describe the activation of {\$}\beta{\$}-secretase and c-jun N-terminal kinase related proteins by monomeric A{\$}\beta{\$} 1-42, defining the conditions that most efficiently strike the described signaling without producing toxicity. Taken together these data imply that monomeric A{\$}\beta{\$} 1-42, at non-toxic concentrations and time frames, are able to induce a signaling pathway that leads to transcriptional activation of {\$}\beta{\$}-secretase.},

	Abstract = {Calcium modulates many neural processes, including synaptic plasticity and apoptosis. Dysregulation of intracellular calcium signalling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Increased intracellular calcium elicits the characteristic lesions of this disorder, including the accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$, the hyperphosphorylation of TAU and neuronal death. Conversely, neurodegeneration that is induced by amyloid-$\beta$ or TAU is probably mediated by changes in calcium homeostasis. Disruption of calcium regulation in the endoplasmic reticulum mediates the most significant signal-transduction cascades that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease have been linked to intracellular calcium signalling pathways. Destabilization of calcium signalling seems to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and targeting this process might be therapeutically beneficial.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a unique view of the working human mind. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, detected in fMRI, reflects changes in deoxyhemoglobin driven by localized changes in brain blood flow and blood oxygenation, which are coupled to underlying neuronal activity by a process termed neurovascular coupling. Over the past 10 years, a range of cellular mechanisms, including astrocytes, pericytes, and interneurons, have been proposed to play a role in functional neurovascular coupling. However, the field remains conflicted over the relative importance of each process, while key spatiotemporal features of BOLD response remain unexplained. Here, we review current candidate neurovascular coupling mechanisms and propose that previously overlooked involvement of the vascular endothelium may provide a more complete picture of how blood flow is controlled in the brain. We also explore the possibility and consequences of conditions in which neurovascular coupling may be altered, including during postnatal development, pathological states, and aging, noting relevance to both stimulus-evoked and resting-state fMRI studies.},

	Abstract = {The effect of cyclic blood flow velocity on local tissue oxygenation was studied by means of a mathematical simulation in the situation where red blood cells (RBC) act as discrete oxygen sources. Cyclic time varying fluctuations of capillary blood (flowmotion) are due to arteriolar vasomotion. This effect was introduced into the model as an oscillating RBC velocity with equal periods of high and low velocity regulated by a square wave function. Changes in RBC velocity coupled with a constant time-average capillary hematocrit lead to periods of high and low flux. Input parameters were flowmotion frequency and amplitude, capillary hematocrit, and mean RBC velocity. All results were related to baseline states where the velocity and hematocrit are steady. Our principle finding is that flowmotion alters the tissue oxygenation, whereby: 1) high amplitudes of flowmotion cause a modest increase in axial delivery of oxygen but with a decreased average tissue pO2; 2) decreasing flowmotion frequencies lead to increased radial penetration of oxygen; 3) the lower frequencies of flowmotion cause an increase in the volume of tissue that achieves at least a pO2 level of 5 mmHg. Isovolemic hemodilution was simulated and found to substantially increase the volume of oxygenated tissue as a function of flowmotion. These findings indicate that pO2 transients caused by flowmotion oxygenate tissue domains which under steady-state conditions would remain anoxic.},

Specifically, we focus on the pressure and flowrate distribution at different segments of the network computed by the two models. Results obtained with 1D and 3D models with rigid walls show good agreement in massflow distribution at tens of arterial junctions and also in pressure drop along the arteries. The 3D simulations with the rigid walls predict higher amplitude of the flowrate and pressure temporal oscillations than the 1D simulations with compliant walls at various segments even for small time-variations in the arterial cross-sectional areas. Sensitivity of the flow and pressure with respect to variation in the elasticity parameters is investigated with the 1D model.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular Ca2+ signaling is considered to be important for multiple astrocyte functions in neural circuits. However, mice devoid of inositol triphosphate type 2 receptors (IP3R2) reportedly lack all astrocyte Ca2+ signaling, but display no neuronal or neurovascular deficits, implying that astrocyte Ca2+ fluctuations are not involved in these functions. An assumption has been that the loss of somatic Ca2+ fluctuations also reflects a similar loss in astrocyte processes. We tested this assumption and found diverse types of Ca2+ fluctuations in astrocytes, with most occurring in processes rather than in somata. These fluctuations were preserved in Ip3r2-/- (also known as Itpr2-/-) mice in brain slices and in vivo, occurred in end feet, and were increased by G protein-coupled receptor activation and by startle-induced neuromodulatory responses. Our data reveal previously unknown Ca2+ fluctuations in astrocytes and highlight limitations of studies that used Ip3r2-/- mice to evaluate astrocyte contributions to neural circuit function and mouse behavior.},

	Abstract = {Conduction processes in the vasculature have traditionally been described using cable theory, i.e., locally induced signals decaying passively along the arteriolar wall. The decay is typically quantified using the steady-state length-constant, {\$}\lambda{\$}, derived from cable theory. However, the applicability of cable theory to blood vessels depends on assumptions that are not necessarily fulfilled in small arteries and arterioles. We have employed a morphologically and electrophysiologically detailed mathematical model of a rat mesenteric arteriole to investigate if the assumptions hold and whether {\$}\lambda{\$} adequately describes simulated conduction profiles. We find that several important cable theory assumptions are violated when applied to small blood vessels. However, the phenomenological use of a length-constant from a single exponential function is a good measure of conduction length. Hence, {\$}\lambda{\$} should be interpreted as a descriptive measure and not in light of cable theory. Determination of {\$}\lambda{\$} using cable theory assumes steady-state conditions. In contrast, using the model it is possible to probe how conduction behaves before steady state is achieved. As ion channels have time-dependent activation and inactivation, the conduction profile changes considerably during this dynamic period with an initially longer spread of current. This may have implications in relation to explaining why different agonists have different conduction properties. Also, it illustrates the necessity of using and developing models that handle the nonlinearity of ion channels. {\textcopyright}2012 Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {To study endothelial cell (EC)- specific Ca(2+) signaling in vivo we engineered transgenic mice in which the Ca(2+) sensor GCaMP2 is placed under control of endogenous connexin40 (Cx40) transcription regulatory elements within a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), resulting in high sensor expression in arterial ECs, atrial myocytes, and cardiac Purkinje fibers. High signal/noise Ca(2+) signals were obtained in Cx40(BAC)-GCaMP2 mice within the ventricular Purkinje cell network in vitro and in ECs of cremaster muscle arterioles in vivo. Microiontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) onto arterioles triggered a transient increase in EC Ca(2+) fluorescence that propagated along the arteriole with an initial velocity of approximately 116 microm/s (n=28) and decayed over distances up to 974 microm. The local rise in EC Ca(2+) was followed (delay, 830+/-60 ms; n=8) by vasodilation that conducted rapidly (mm/s), bidirectionally, and into branches for distances exceeding 1 mm. At intermediate distances (300 to 600 microm), rapidly-conducted vasodilation occurred without changing EC Ca(2+), and additional dilation occurred after arrival of a Ca(2+) wave. In contrast, focal delivery of sodium nitroprusside evoked similar local dilations without Ca(2+) signaling or conduction. We conclude that in vivo responses to ACh in arterioles consists of 2 phases: (1) a rapidly-conducted vasodilation initiated by a local rise in EC Ca(2+) but independent of EC Ca(2+) signaling at remote sites; and (2) a slower complementary dilation associated with a Ca(2+) wave that propagates along the endothelium.},

	Abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is an most important mechanism responsible for the relatively constant blood flow supply to brain when cerebral perfusion pressure varies. Its assessment in nonacute cases has been relied on the quantification of the relationship between noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and blood flow velocity (BFV). To overcome the nonstationary nature of physiological signals such as BP and BFV, a computational method called multimodal pressure-flow (MMPF) analysis was recently developed to study the nonlinear BP-BFV relationship during the Valsalva maneuver (VM). The present study aimed to determine (i) whether this method can estimate autoregulation from spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations during baseline rest conditions; (ii) whether there is any difference between the MMPF measures of autoregulation based on intra-arterial BP (ABP) and based on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP); and (iii) whether the MMPF method provides reproducible and reliable measure for noninvasive assessment of autoregulation. To achieve these aims, we analyzed data from existing databases including: (i) ABP and BFV of 12 healthy control, 10 hypertensive, and 10 stroke subjects during baseline resting conditions and during the Valsalva maneuver, and (ii) ABP, CPP, and BFV of 30 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were being paralyzed, sedated, and ventilated. We showed that autoregulation in healthy control subjects can be characterized by specific phase shifts between BP and BFV oscillations during the Valsalva maneuver, and the BP-BFV phase shifts were reduced in hypertensive and stroke subjects (P {\textless} 0.01), indicating impaired autoregulation. Similar results were found during baseline condition from spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations. The BP-BFV phase shifts obtained during baseline and during VM were highly correlated (R {\textgreater} 0.8, P {\textless} 0.0001), showing no statistical difference (paired-t test P {\textgreater} 0.47). In TBI patients there were strong correlations between phases of ABP and CPP oscillations (R = 0.99, P {\textless} 0.0001) and, thus, between ABP-BFV and CPP-BFV phase shifts (P {\textless} 0.0001, R = 0.76). By repeating the MMPF 4 times on data of TBI subjects, each time on a selected cycle of spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations, we showed that MMPF had better reproducibility than traditional autoregulation index. These results indicate that the MMPF method, based on instantaneous phase relationships between cerebral blood flow velocity and peripheral blood pressure, has better performance than the traditional standard method, and can reliably assess cerebral autoregulation dynamics from ambulatory blood pressure and cerebral blood flow during supine rest conditions.},

	Abstract = {Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) modulate smooth muscle cell (SMC) contractility, assisting in vascular tone regulation. Cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and membrane potential (V(m)) play important roles in this process by controlling EC-dependent vasoactive signals and intercellular communication. The present mathematical model integrates plasmalemma electrophysiology and Ca(2+) dynamics to investigate EC responses to different stimuli and the controversial relationship between [Ca(2+)](i) and V(m). The model contains descriptions for the intracellular balance of major ionic species and the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. It also expands previous formulations by including more detailed transmembrane current descriptions. The model reproduces V(m) responses to volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) blockers and extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)](o)) challenges, predicting 1) that V(m) changes upon VRAC blockade are [K(+)](o) dependent and 2) a biphasic response of V(m) to increasing [K(+)](o). Simulations of agonist-induced Ca(2+) mobilization replicate experiments under control and V(m) hyperpolarization blockade conditions. They show that peak [Ca(2+)](i) is governed by store Ca(2+) release while Ca(2+) influx (and consequently V(m)) impacts more the resting and plateau [Ca(2+)](i). The V(m) sensitivity of rest and plateau [Ca(2+)](i) is dictated by a [Ca(2+)](i) "buffering" system capable of masking the V(m)-dependent transmembrane Ca(2+) influx. The model predicts plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase and Ca(2+) permeability as main players in this process. The heterogeneous V(m) impact on [Ca(2+)](i) may elucidate conflicting reports on how V(m) influences EC Ca(2+). The present study forms the basis for the development of multicellular EC-SMC models that can assist in understanding vascular autoregulation in health and disease.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+-ATPases (pumps) are key actors in the regulation of Ca2+ in eukaryotic cells and are thus essential to the correct functioning of the cell machinery. They have high affinity for Ca2+ and can efficiently regulate it down to very low concentration levels. Two of the pumps have been known for decades (the SERCA and PMCA pumps); one (the SPCA pump) has only become known recently. Each pump is the product of a multigene family, the number of isoforms being further increased by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts. The three pumps share the basic features of the catalytic mechanism but differ in a number of properties related to tissue distribution, regulation, and role in the cellular homeostasis of Ca2+. The molecular understanding of the function of the pumps has received great impetus from the solution of the three-dimensional structure of one of them, the SERCA pump. These spectacular advances in the structure and molecular mechanism of the pumps have been accompanied by the emergence and rapid expansion of the topic of pump malfunction, which has paralleled the rapid expansion of knowledge in the topic of Ca2+-signaling dysfunction. Most of the pump defects described so far are genetic: when they are very severe, they produce gross and global disturbances of Ca2+ homeostasis that are incompatible with cell life. However, pump defects may also be of a type that produce subtler, often tissue-specific disturbances that affect individual components of the Ca2+-controlling and/or processing machinery. They do not bring cells to immediate death but seriously compromise their normal functioning.},

	Abstract = {Although the chemical nature of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) remains elusive, electrophysiological evidence exists for electrical communication between smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells suggesting that electrotonic propagation of hyperpolarization may explain the failure to identify a single chemical factor as EDHF. Anatomical evidence for myoendothelial gap junctions, or the sites of electrical coupling, is, however, rare. In the present study, serial-section electron microscopy and reconstruction techniques have been used to examine the incidence of myoendothelial gap junctions in the proximal and distal mesenteric arteries of the rat where EDHF responses have been reported to vary. Myoendothelial gap junctions were found to be very small in the mesenteric arteries, the majority being {\textless}100 nm in diameter. In addition, they were significantly more common in the distal compared with the proximal regions of this arterial bed. Pentalaminar gap junctions between adjacent endothelial cells were much larger and were common in both proximal and distal mesenteric arteries. These latter junctions were frequently found near the myoendothelial gap junctions. These results provide the first evidence for the presence of sites for electrical communication between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in the mesenteric vascular bed. Furthermore, the relative incidence of these sites suggests that there may be a relationship between the activity of EDHF and the presence of myoendothelial gap junctions.},

	Abstract = {Brain imaging methods, and in particular fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), do not detect neural activity directly, but rather changes in blood flow and oxygenation in neighboring blood vessels, this being the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) effect. We have constructed a model of the steps leading from neural activity to increased blood flow in arterioles, in which astrocytes play a crucial role. Glutamate released from neuronal synapses binds to metabotropic receptors on the astrocyte processes that ensheath these synapses. This initiates a calcium wave that travels along the endfeet of astrocytes that abut the endothelial cells forming the walls of blood capillaries; this calcium wave is propagated by the extracellular diffusion of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) that acts on metabotropic purinergic receptors on the astrocytes. A further second messenger (taken to be nitric oxide) relays this signal to the smooth muscle cells forming the outer walls of arterioles, and the subsequent wave of hyperpolarization reduces calcium influx and allows relaxation of the muscle cells and hence increased blood flow. The model gives results that are in agreement with experimental measurements of blood volume changes in the arterioles in the visual cortex of optically stimulated cats. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in autocrine and paracrine manner in numerous physiological processes, including regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. In vascular wall, most of the bioavailable NO is believed to derive from endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS). Recently, neuronal NOS (nNOS) has been identified as a source of NO in the vicinity of microvessels and has been shown to participate in vascular function. Thus NO can be produced and transported to the vascular smooth muscle cells from 1). endothelial cells and 2). perivascular nerve fibers, mast cells, and other nNOS-containing sources. In this study, a mathematical model of NO diffusion-reaction in a cylindrical arteriolar segment was formulated. The model quantifies the relative contribution of these NO sources and the smooth muscle availability of NO in a tissue containing an arteriolar blood vessel. The results indicate that a source of NO derived through nNOS in the perivascular region can be a significant contributor to smooth muscle NO. Predicted smooth muscle NO concentrations are as high as 430 nM, which is consistent with reported experimental measurements approximately 400 nM). In addition, we used the model to analyze the smooth muscle NO availability in 1). eNOS and nNOS knockout experiments, 2). the presence of myoglobin, and 3). the presence of cell-free Hb, e.g., Hb-based oxygen carriers. The results show that NO release by nNOS would significantly affect available smooth muscle NO. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to account for distribution of NOS isoforms and determine NO availability in vasculatures of different tissues.},

	Abstract = {The term cerebral small vessel disease refers to a group of pathological processes with various aetiologies that affect the small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the brain. Age-related and hypertension-related small vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms. The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Large amounts of energy are required to maintain the signaling activities of CNS cells. Because of the fine-grained heterogeneity of brain and the rapid changes in energy demand, it has been difficult to monitor rates of energy generation and consumption at the cellular level and even more difficult at the subcellular level. Mechanisms to facilitate energy transfer within cells include the juxtaposition of sites of generation with sites of consumption and the transfer of {\~{}}P by the creatine kinase/creatine phosphate and the adenylate kinase systems. There is evidence that glycolysis is separated from oxidative metabolism at some sites with lactate becoming an important substrate. Carbonic anhydrase may play a role in buffering activity-induced increases in lactic acid. Relatively little energy is used for 'vegetative' processes. The great majority is used for signaling processes, particularly Na+ transport. The brain has very small energy reserves, and the margin of safety between the energy that can be generated and the energy required for maximum activity is also small. It seems probable that the supply of energy may impose a limit on the activity of a neuron under normal conditions. A number of mechanisms have evolved to reduce activity when energy levels are diminished. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	Abstract = {In vivo studies on frog mesenteric arterioles (4) indicate that segmental differences in the response of microvessels to physical and chemical stimuli can be explained simply in terms of the length-tension characteristics of vascular smooth muscle at different points along the vascular tree. Studies on single, isolated arterioles in vitro were initiated to examine more closely the validity of this explanation for regional response differences. This paper reports some of the results. First-, second-, and third-order arterioles (18-60 micron i.d.) were dissected from hamster cheek pouches. The vessels were cannulated with a modified Burg microperfusion system, and their mechanical properties studied using the methods described by Duling and Gore. Vessels were activated in four stages with K+ and norepinephrine. During activation, transmural pressures were adjusted to minimize vascular smooth-muscle shortening. Active pressure-diameter curves were recorded while adjusting transmural pressure through the range 5 to 400 cm H20 in 5-25 cm steps. Vessel dimensions were measured with a videomicrometer. Passive curves were obtained after equilibration overnight in Ca2+-free medium. The vessels were then fixed and prepared for histologic sectioning, and measurements of vessel-wall composition were made. The Laplace relationship was used to construct length-tension diagrams, and the histologic data were used to normalize the dimensional data to smooth-muscle lengths. Maximum active tension of second-order arterioles (1,170 dynes/cm) was two times previous values reported by Gore et al. This was due presumably to refinements in techniques and dissection procedures. Maximum active stress averaged 3.9 X 10(+6) dynes/cm2 for second-order arterioles. This number is identical to data obtained from hog carotid strips by Dillon et al.},

@article{Heinrich2010,
	Abstract = {Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants. Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing-resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional, synapse-forming neurons. Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx2-mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2, suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant. Interestingly, however, reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2. Importantly, this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor, stably generating fully differentiated neurons. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.},

@article{Zheng2010,
	Abstract = {Neurovascular coupling in response to stimulation of the rat barrel cortex was investigated using concurrent multichannel electrophysiology and laser Doppler flowmetry. The data were used to build a linear dynamic model relating neural activity to blood flow. Local field potential time series were subject to current source density analysis, and the time series of a layer IV sink of the barrel cortex was used as the input to the model. The model output was the time series of the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). We show that this model can provide excellent fit of the CBF responses for stimulus durations of up to 16 s. The structure of the model consisted of two coupled components representing vascular dilation and constriction. The complex temporal characteristics of the CBF time series were reproduced by the relatively simple balance of these two components. We show that the impulse response obtained under the 16-s duration stimulation condition generalised to provide a good prediction to the data from the shorter duration stimulation conditions. Furthermore, by optimising three out of the total of nine model parameters, the variability in the data can be well accounted for over a wide range of stimulus conditions. By establishing linearity, classic system analysis methods can be used to generate and explore a range of equivalent model structures (e.g., feed-forward or feedback) to guide the experimental investigation of the control of vascular dilation and constriction following stimulation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {The inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 has been suggested to underlie the principal K+ conductance of mammalian Muller cells and to participate in the generation of field potentials and regulation of extracellular K+ in the retina. To further assess the role of Kir4.1 in the retina, we generated a mouse line with targeted disruption of the Kir4.1 gene (Kir4.1 [-]/[-]). Muller cells from Kir4.1 [-]/[-] mice were not labeled with an anti-Kir4.1 antibody, although they appeared morphologically normal when stained with an anti-glutamine synthetase antibody. In contrast, in Muller cells from wild-type littermate (Kir4.1 +/+) mice, Kir4.1 was present and localized to the proximal endfeet and perivascular processes. In situ whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed a 10-fold increase in the input resistance and a large depolarization of Kir4.1 [-]/[-] Muller cells compared with Kir4.1 +/+ cells. The slow PIII response of the light-evoked electroretinogram (ERG), which is generated by K+ fluxes through Muller cells, was totally absent in retinas from Kir4.1 [-]/[-] mice. The b-wave of the ERG, in contrast, was spared in the null mice. Overall, these results indicate that Kir4.1 is the principal K+ channel subunit expressed in mouse Muller glial cells. The highly regulated localization and the functional properties of Kir4.1 in Muller cells suggest the involvement of this channel in the regulation of extracellular K+ in the mouse retina.$\backslash$n},

	Abstract = {Cyclooxygenase (COX) is a prostanoid-synthesizing enzyme present in 2 isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. Although it has long been hypothesized that prostanoids participate in cerebrovascular regulation, the lack of adequate pharmacological tools has led to conflicting results and has not permitted investigators to define the relative contribution of COX-1 and COX-2. We used the COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 and COX-1-null (COX-1(-/-)) mice to investigate whether COX-1 plays a role in cerebrovascular regulation. Mice were anesthetized (urethane and chloralose) and equipped with a cranial window. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry or by the (14)C-iodoantipyrine technique with quantitative autoradiography. In wild-type mice, SC-560 (25 micromol/L) reduced resting CBF by 21+/-4{\%} and attenuated the CBF increase produced by topical application of bradykinin (-59{\%}) or calcium ionophore A23187 (-49{\%}) and by systemic hypercapnia (-58{\%}) (P{\textless}0.05 to 0.01). However, SC-560 did not reduce responses to acetylcholine or the increase in somatosensory cortex blood flow produced by vibrissal stimulation. In COX-1(-/-) mice, resting CBF assessed by (14)C-iodoantipyrine was reduced (-13{\%} to -20{\%}) in cerebral cortex and other telencephalic regions (P{\textless}0.05). The CBF increase produced by bradykinin, A23187, and hypercapnia, but not acetylcholine or vibrissal stimulation, were attenuated (P{\textless}0.05 to 0.01). The free radical scavenger superoxide dismutase attenuated responses to bradykinin and A23187 in wild-type mice but not in COX-1(-/-) mice, suggesting that COX-1 is the source of the reactive oxygen species known to mediate these responses. The data provide evidence for a critical role of COX-1 in maintaining resting vascular tone and in selected vasodilator responses of the cerebral microcirculation.},

	Abstract = {The retinal vasculature supplies cells of the inner and middle layers of the retina with oxygen and nutrients. Photic stimulation dilates retinal arterioles producing blood flow increases, a response termed functional hyperemia. Despite recent advances, the neurovascular coupling mechanisms mediating the functional hyperemia response in the retina remain unclear. In this review, the retinal functional hyperemia response is described, and the cellular mechanisms that may mediate the response are assessed. These neurovascular coupling mechanisms include neuronal stimulation of glial cells, leading to the release of vasoactive arachidonic acid metabolites onto blood vessels, release of potassium from glial cells onto vessels, and production and release of nitric oxide (NO), lactate, and adenosine from neurons and glia. The modulation of neurovascular coupling by oxygen and NO are described, and changes in functional hyperemia that occur with aging and in diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and other pathologies, are reviewed. Finally, outstanding questions concerning retinal blood flow in health and disease are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Connexins (Cxs) 40, 43, and 45 are expressed in many different tissues, but most abundantly in the heart, blood vessels, and the nervous system. We examined formation and gating properties of heterotypic gap junction (GJ) channels assembled between cells expressing wild-type Cx40, Cx43, or Cx45 and their fusion forms tagged with color variants of green fluorescent protein. We show that these Cxs, with exception of Cxs 40 and 43, are compatible to form functional heterotypic GJ channels. Cx40 and Cx43 hemichannels are unable or effectively impaired in their ability to dock and/or assemble into junctional plaques. When cells expressing Cx45 contacted those expressing Cx40 or Cx43 they readily formed junctional plaques with cell-cell coupling characterized by asymmetric junctional conductance dependence on transjunctional voltage, V(j). Cx40/Cx45 heterotypic GJ channels preferentially exhibit V(j)-dependent gating transitions between open and residual states with a conductance of approximately 42 pS; transitions between fully open and closed states with conductance of approximately 52 pS in magnitude occur at substantially lower ( approximately 10-fold) frequency. Cx40/Cx45 junctions demonstrate electrical signal transfer asymmetry that can be modulated between unidirectional and bidirectional by small changes in the difference between holding potentials of the coupled cells. Furthermore, both fast and slow gating mechanisms of Cx40 exhibit a negative gating polarity.},

	Abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) has traditionally been regarded as an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS in which clinical symptoms result from axon conduction block caused by myelin degradation. However, typical accumulation of permanent neurological deficits during the clinical course of MS cannot be explained solely by de- and remyelinating processes. It is considered to be rather due to neuronal degeneration, for which several reasons could be identified depending on the state of the disease. First, neurons and their axons can be damaged by infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages either directly by cell-to-cell contact or by the release of harmful mediators such as nitric oxide or glutamate. Second, indirect injury to neurons and axons may occur through the loss of trophic support by neighbouring oligodendrocytes due to destruction of both the myelin sheath and the oligodendrocyte itself. Third, redistribution of certain voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and transporters along naked demyelinated axons restores axonal conduction but also leads to excessive spatially restricted electrical activity of the axonal membrane, intracellular calcium accumulation, impairment of mitochondrial function, and subsequent neuronal degeneration. The neuroprotective potential of pharmacological modulation of these channels and transporters using already approved drugs has been demonstrated in several animal studies, is the subject of current clinical trials and will be the topic of this review.},

	Abstract = {Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are exposed to hemodynamic forces, which modulate EC functions and vascular biology/pathobiology in health and disease. The flow patterns and hemodynamic forces are not uniform in the vascular system. In straight parts of the arterial tree, blood flow is generally laminar and wall shear stress is high and directed; in branches and curvatures, blood flow is disturbed with nonuniform and irregular distribution of low wall shear stress. Sustained laminar flow with high shear stress upregulates expressions of EC genes and proteins that are protective against atherosclerosis, whereas disturbed flow with associated reciprocating, low shear stress generally upregulates the EC genes and proteins that promote atherogenesis. These findings have led to the concept that the disturbed flow pattern in branch points and curvatures causes the preferential localization of atherosclerotic lesions. Disturbed flow also results in postsurgical neointimal hyperplasia and contributes to pathophysiology of clinical conditions such as in-stent restenosis, vein bypass graft failure, and transplant vasculopathy, as well as aortic valve calcification. In the venous system, disturbed flow resulting from reflux, outflow obstruction, and/or stasis leads to venous inflammation and thrombosis, and hence the development of chronic venous diseases. Understanding of the effects of disturbed flow on ECs can provide mechanistic insights into the role of complex flow patterns in pathogenesis of vascular diseases and can help to elucidate the phenotypic and functional differences between quiescent (nonatherogenic/nonthrombogenic) and activated (atherogenic/thrombogenic) ECs. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of disturbed flow in EC physiology and pathophysiology, as well as its clinical implications. Such information can contribute to our understanding of the etiology of lesion development in vascular niches with disturbed flow and help to generate new approaches for therapeutic interventions.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain is thought to be coupled to cerebral arterioles (functional hyperemia) through Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. Although functional hyperemia occurs rapidly, within seconds, such rapid signaling has not been demonstrated in situ, and Ca2+ measurements in parenchymal arterioles are still lacking. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope and fluorescence Ca2+ indicators, we provide the first evidence that in a brain slice preparation, increased neuronal activity by electrical stimulation (ES) is rapidly signaled, within seconds, to cerebral arterioles and is associated with astrocytic Ca2+ waves. Smooth muscle cells in parenchymal arterioles exhibited Ca2+ and diameter oscillations ("vasomotion") that were rapidly suppressed by ES. The neuronal-mediated Ca2+ rise in cortical astrocytes was dependent on intracellular (inositol trisphosphate [IP3]) and extracellular voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel sources. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented the rise in astrocytic [Ca2+]i and the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles to ES, indicating that neuronal activity was necessary for both events. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes significantly decreased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles. This study supports the concept that astrocytic Ca2+ changes signal the cerebral microvasculature and indicate the novel concept that this communication occurs through the suppression of arteriolar [Ca2+]i oscillations and corresponding vasomotion.

	Abstract = {Background: To what extent is activity of individual neurons coupled to the local field potential (LFP) and to blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)? This issue is of high significance for understanding brain function and for relating animal studies to fMRI, yet it is still under debate. Results: Here we report data from simultaneous recordings of isolated unit activity and LFP by using multiple electrodes in the human auditory cortex. We found a wide range of coupling levels between the activity of individual neurons and gamma LFP. However, this large variability could be predominantly explained (r = 0.66) by the degree of firing-rate correlations between neighboring neurons. Importantly, this phenomenon occurred during both sensory stimulation and spontaneous activity. Concerning the coupling of neuronal activity to BOLD fMRI, we found that gamma LFP was well coupled to BOLD measured across different individuals (r = 0.62). By contrast, the coupling of single units to BOLD was highly variable and, again, tightly related to interneuronal-firing-rate correlations (r = 0.70). Conclusions: Our results offer a resolution to a central controversy regarding the coupling between neurons, LFP, and BOLD signals by demonstrating, for the first time, that the coupling of single units to the other measures is variable yet it is tightly related to the degree of interneuronal correlations in the human auditory cortex. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the BOLD signal reflects changes in blood volume and oxygenation rather than neuronal activity per se. Therefore, understanding the transformation of microscopic vascular behavior into macroscopic BOLD signals is at the foundation of physiologically informed noninvasive neuroimaging. Here, we use oxygen-sensitive two-photon microscopy to measure the BOLD-relevant microvascular physiology occurring within a typical rodent fMRI voxel and predict the BOLD signal from first principles using those measurements. The predictive power of the approach is illustrated by quantifying variations in the BOLD signal induced by the morphological folding of the human cortex.

	Abstract = {The intercellular synchronization of spontaneous calcium (Ca(2+)) oscillations in individual smooth muscle cells is a prerequisite for vasomotion. A detailed mathematical model of Ca(2+) dynamics in rat mesenteric arteries shows that a number of synchronizing and desynchronizing pathways may be involved. In particular, Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipase C, the intercellular diffusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3), and to a lesser extent Ca(2+)), IP(3) receptors, diacylglycerol-activated nonselective cation channels, and Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels can contribute to synchronization, whereas large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels have a desynchronizing effect. Depending on the contractile state and agonist concentrations, different pathways become predominant, and can be revealed by carefully inhibiting the oscillatory component of their total activity. The phase shift between the Ca(2+) and membrane potential oscillations can change, and thus electrical coupling through gap junctions can mediate either synchronization or desynchronization. The effect of the endothelium is highly variable because it can simultaneously enhance the intercellular coupling and affect multiple smooth muscle cell components. Here, we outline a system of increased complexity and propose potential synchronization mechanisms that need to be experimentally tested.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016 The Author(s). Spreading depolarizations are implicated in a diverse set of neurologic diseases. They are unusual forms of nervous system activity in that they propagate very slowly and approximately concentrically, apparently not respecting the anatomic, synaptic, functional, or vascular architecture of the brain. However, there is evidence that spreading depolarizations are not truly concentric, isotropic, or homogeneous, either in space or in time. Here we present evidence from KCl-induced spreading depolarizations, in mouse and rat, in vivo and in vitro, showing the great variability that these depolarizations can exhibit. This variability can help inform the mechanistic understanding of spreading depolarizations, and it has implications for their phenomenology in neurologic disease.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal stimulation causes approximately 30{\%} shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.},

	Abstract = {In rat mesenteric arteries, smooth muscle cells exhibit intercellular calcium waves in response to local phenylephrine stimulation. These waves have a velocity of approximately 20 cells/s and a range of approximately 80 cells. We analyze these waves in a theoretical model of a population of coupled smooth muscle cells, based on the hypothesis that the wave results from cell membrane depolarization propagation. We study the underlying mechanisms and highlight the importance of voltage-operated channels, calcium-induced calcium release, and chloride channels. Our model is in agreement with experimental observations, and we demonstrate that calcium waves presenting a velocity of approximately 20 cells/s can be mediated by electrical coupling. The wave velocity is limited by the time needed for calcium influx through voltage-operated calcium channels and the subsequent calcium-induced calcium release, and not by the speed of the depolarization spreading. The waves are partially regenerated, but have a spatial limit in propagation. Moreover, the model predicts that a refractory period of calcium signaling may significantly affect the wave appearance.},

	Abstract = {The flow-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) rise in endothelial cells is an important early event leading to flow-induced blood vessel dilation. Transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 4 (TRPV4), a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel, facilitates the flow-stimulated [Ca(2+)]i rise. To determine whether TRPV4 is involved in age-related flow-induced blood vessel dilation impairment, we measured blood vessel diameter and nitric oxide (NO) levels and performed Ca(2+) imaging, immunoblotting, and immunostaining assays in rats. We found that the flow-induced and TRPV4 activator 4{\$}\alpha{\$}-PDD-induced dilation of mesenteric arteries from aged rats were significantly decreased compared with those from young rats. The flow- or 4{\$}\alpha{\$}-PDD-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise was also markedly reduced in primary cultured mesenteric artery endothelial cells (MAECs) from aged rats. Immunoblotting and immunostaining results showed an age-related decrease of TRPV4 expression levels in MAECs. Additionally, the 4{\$}\alpha{\$}-PDD-induced NO production was significantly reduced in aged MAECs. Compared with lentiviral GFP-treated aged rats, lentiviral vector delivery of TRPV4 increased TRPV4 expression level in aged MAECs and restored the flow- and 4{\$}\alpha{\$}-PDD-induced vessel dilation in aged mesenteric arteries. We concluded that impaired TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) signaling causes endothelial dysfunction and that TRPV4 is a potential target for clinical treatment of age-related vascular system diseases.},

	Abstract = {Low nanomolar concentrations of nitric oxide activate guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which has diverse physiological effects. Higher concentrations inhibit mitochondrial respiration at cytochrome c oxidase and this has been proposed to be important physiologically, increasing oxygen permeation into tissue (by reducing the oxygen use of cells near blood vessels), activating AMP kinase, and regulating the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen use. It is unclear, however, whether nitric oxide can accumulate physiologically to concentrations at which inhibition of respiration occurs. In rat cerebellar slices, we activated nitric oxide production from each isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Only activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which is expressed pathologically, caused any significant inhibition of respiration. Modelling oxygen and nitric oxide concentrations predicted that, in vivo, physiological nitric oxide levels are too low to affect respiration. Even pathologically, the nitric oxide concentration may only rise to 2.5 nm, producing a 1.5{\%} inhibition of respiration. Thus, under physiological conditions, nitric oxide signals do not inhibit respiration but are well-tuned to the dynamic range of guanylyl cyclase activation.},

@article{Peers2009,
	Abstract = {Periods of chronic hypoxia, which can arise from numerous cardiorespiratory disorders, predispose individuals to the development of dementias, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized in part by the increased production of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), which forms the extracellular plaques by which the disease can be identified post mortem. Numerous studies have now shown that hypoxia, even in vitro, can increase production of Abeta in different cell types. Evidence has been produced to indicate hypoxia alters both expression of the Abeta precursor, APP, and also the expression of the secretase enzymes, which cleave Abeta from APP. Other studies implicate reduced Abeta degradation as a possible means by which hypoxia increases Abeta levels. Such variability may be attributable to cell-specific responses to hypoxia. Further evidence indicates that some, but not all of the cellular adaptations to chronic hypoxia (including alteration of Ca(2+) homeostasis) require Abeta formation. However, other aspects of hypoxic remodeling of cell function appear to occur independently of this process. The molecular and cellular responses to hypoxia contribute to our understanding of the clinical association of hypoxia and increased incidence of AD. However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of one or more of the effects of hypoxia may be of benefit in arresting the development of this neurodegenerative disease.},

	Abstract = {Shear stress stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by phosphorylating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser(1179) in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. The eNOS has additional potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser(116), Thr(497), and Ser(635). Here, we studied these potential phosphorylation sites in response to shear, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and 8-bromocAMP (8-BRcAMP) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). All three stimuli induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(635), which was consistently slower than that at Ser(1179). Thr(497) was rapidly dephosphorylated by 8-BRcAMP but not by shear and VEGF. None of the stimuli phosphorylated Ser(116). Whereas shear-stimulated Ser(635) phosphorylation was not affected by phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002, it was blocked by either treating the cells with a PKA inhibitor H89 or infecting them with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing PKA inhibitor. These results suggest that shear stress stimulates eNOS by two different mechanisms: 1) PKA- and PI3K-dependent and 2) PKA-dependent but PI3K-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of Ser(635) may play an important role in chronic regulation of eNOS in response to mechanical and humoral stimuli.},

Ca(2+) signaling leads to the modification of a variety of EC functions, including the production of vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin. However, the molecular mechanisms for ATP-induced Ca(2+) influx in ECs have not been thoroughly clarified. Here we demonstrate evidence that a P2X(4) receptor for an ATP-gated cation channel is predominantly expressed in human ECs and is involved in the ATP-induced Ca(2+) influx. Northern blot analysis distinctly showed the expression of P2X(4) mRNA in human ECs cultured from the umbilical vein, aorta, pulmonary artery, and skin microvessels. Competitive PCR revealed that P2X(4) mRNA expression was much higher in ECs than was the expression of other subtypes, including P2X(1), P2X(3), P2X(5), and P2X(7). Treatment of ECs with antisense oligonucleotides designed to target the P2X(4) receptor decreased the P2X(4) mRNA and protein levels to approximately 25{\%} of control levels and markedly prevented the ATP-induced Ca(2+) influx.},

	Abstract = {The transcription factor encoded by Fez family zinc finger 2 (Fezf2) is necessary for normal development of the cerebral cortex. However, Fezf2 continues to be expressed in the mature brain, indicating that it might also be necessary for cortical function throughout life. Here, we show a unique identity of Fezf2-expressing intratelencephalic-projection neurons (IT-PNs) in layer 5 of the mature mouse motor cortex, using a Fezf2-Gfp reporter mouse, in vivo retrograde labeling, whole-cell electrophysiology with morphology reconstruction, and cluster analysis. Fezf2-expressing IT-PNs occupy layer 5A and display an apical dendritic tuft; functionally, they fire broad, adapting action potentials and exhibit an Ih-mediated voltage sag that influences their synaptic properties. In contrast, IT-PNs without Fezf2 expression mainly occupy layer 5B, do not display a tuft, and exhibit regular action potential firing and little sag. Both groups of IT-PNs demonstrated distinct frequency-selective synaptic responses to commissural inputs, indicating unique contributions within the cortical microcircuitry. Our findings establish a new, distinct physiological identity of Fezf2-expressing neurons within mature motor cortex.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a new intercellular messenger that occurs naturally in the brain without causing overt toxicity. Yet, NO has been implicated as a mediator of cell death in cell death. One explanation is that ischemia causes overproduction of NO, allowing it to react with superoxide to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry for citrulline, a marker for NO synthase activity, and 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker for peroxynitrite formation, in mice subjected to reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. We show that ischemia triggers a marked augmentation in citrulline immunoreactivity but more so in the peri-infarct than the infarcted tissue. This increase is attributable to the activation of a large population (approximately 80{\%}) of the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) that is catalytically inactive during basal conditions, indicating a tight regulation of physiological NO production in the brain. In contrast, 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is restricted to the infarcted tissue and is not present in the peri-infarct tissue. In nNOS(Delta/Delta) mice, known to be protected against ischemia, no 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is detected. Our findings provide a cellular localization for nNOS activation in association with ischemic stroke and establish that NO is not likely a direct neurotoxin, whereas its conversion to peroxynitrite is associated with cell death.},

	Abstract = {P2X4 receptors are adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channels present on the plasma membrane (PM) and also within intracellular compartments such as vesicles, vacuoles, lamellar bodies (LBs), and lysosomes. P2X4 receptors in microglia are up-regulated in epilepsy and in neuropathic pain; that is to say, their total and/or PM expression levels increase. However, the mechanisms underlying up-regulation of microglial P2X4 receptors remain unclear, in part because it has not been possible to image P2X4 receptor distribution within, or trafficking between, cellular compartments. Here, we report the generation of pH-sensitive fluorescently tagged P2X4 receptors that permit evaluations of cell surface and total receptor pools. Capitalizing on information gained from zebrafish P2X4.1 crystal structures, we designed a series of mouse P2X4 constructs in which a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein, superecliptic pHluorin (pHluorin), was inserted into nonconserved regions located within flexible loops of the P2X4 receptor extracellular domain. One of these constructs, in which pHluorin was inserted after lysine 122 (P2X4-pHluorin123), functioned like wild-type P2X4 in terms of its peak ATP-evoked responses, macroscopic kinetics, calcium flux, current-voltage relationship, and sensitivity to ATP. P2X4-pHluorin123 also showed pH-dependent fluorescence changes, and was robustly expressed on the membrane and within intracellular compartments. P2X4-pHluorin123 identified cell surface and intracellular fractions of receptors in HEK-293 cells, hippocampal neurons, C8-B4 microglia, and alveolar type II (ATII) cells. Furthermore, it showed that the subcellular fractions of P2X4-pHluorin123 receptors were cell and compartment specific, for example, being larger in hippocampal neuron somata than in C8-B4 cell somata, and larger in C8-B4 microglial processes than in their somata. In ATII cells, P2X4-pHluorin123 showed that P2X4 receptors were secreted onto the PM when LBs undergo exocytosis. Finally, the use of P2X4-pHluorin123 showed that the modulator ivermectin did not increase the PM fraction of P2X4 receptors and acted allosterically to potentiate P2X4 receptor responses. Collectively, our data suggest that P2X4-pHluorin123 represents a useful optical probe to quantitatively explore P2X4 receptor distribution, trafficking, and up-regulation.},

	Abstract = {The human brain contains two major cell populations, neurons and glia. While neurons are electrically excitable and capable of discharging short voltage pulses known as action potentials, glial cells are not. However, astrocytes, the prevailing subtype of glia in the cortex, are highly connected and can modulate the excitability of neurons by changing the concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular environment, a process called K+ clearance. During the past decade, astrocytes have been the focus of much research, mainly due to their close association with synapses and their modulatory impact on neuronal activity. It has been shown that astrocytes play an essential role in normal brain function including: nitrosative regulation of synaptic release in the neocortex, synaptogenesis, synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we discuss the role of astrocytes in network modulation through their K+ clearance capabilities, a theory that was first raised 50 years ago by Orkand and Kuffler. We will discuss the functional alterations in astrocytic activity that leads to aberrant modulation of network oscillations and synchronous activity.},

@article{Kim2016,
	Abstract = {The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal evoked by brief neural stimulation, the hemodynamic response function (HRF), is a critical feature of neurovascular coupling. The HRF is directly related to local transient changes in oxygen supplied by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen demand, the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). Previous efforts to explain the HRF have relied upon the hypothesis that CBF produces a non-linear venous dilation within the cortical parenchyma. Instead, the observed dynamics correspond to prompt arterial dilation without venous volume change. This work develops an alternative biomechanical model for the BOLD response based on the hypothesis that prompt upstream dilation creates an arterial flow impulse amenable to linear description. This flow model is coupled to a continuum description of oxygen transport. Measurements using high-resolution fMRI demonstrate the efficacy of the model. The model predicts substantial spatial variations of the oxygen saturation along the length of capillaries and veins, and fits the varied gamut of measured HRFs by the combined effects of corresponding CBF and CMRO2 responses. Three interesting relationships among the hemodynamic parameters are predicted. First, there is an offset linear correlation with approximately unity slope between CBF and CMRO2 responses. Second, the HRF undershoot is strongly correlated to the corresponding CBF undershoot. Third, late-time-CMRO2 response can contribute to a slow recovery to baseline, lengthening the HRF undershoot. The model provides a powerful mathematical framework to understand the dynamics of neurovascular and neurometabolic responses that form the BOLD HRF.},

	Abstract = {Fluid shear stress activates the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) by a mechanism which does not require an increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and is sensitive to several kinase inhibitors. Although phosphorylation of eNOS has been suggested to regulate enzyme activity, the mechanism of eNOS activation is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that fluid shear stress elicits the phosphorylation of eNOS on tyrosine and serine residues. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), using wortmannin or a dominant negative mutant of its downstream target, Akt (protein kinase B), prevented the maintained serine phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. Enhancing eNOS phosphorylation by inhibiting serine/threonine phosphatases, increased eNOS activity by approximately twofold, as assessed by the accumulation of intracellular cyclic GMP, without increasing the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+. These data suggest that shear stress activates a pathway involving PI3K and the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates eNOS. This phosphorylation directly increases eNOS activity at resting [Ca2+]i, thus rendering the shear stress-induced activation of eNOS apparently Ca2+-independent.},

	Abstract = {Gap junctions are formed in the cardiovascular system by connexin40 (Cx40), Cx37, Cx43, and Cx45. These low resistance channels allow the transfer of ions and small molecules between cells. The longitudinal coupling of endothelial and smooth muscle cells via gap junctions allows the spread of changes in membrane potential along the vascular wall and hence provides conduction pathways within the vessel itself. Functionally, this tight coupling is reflected by the spread of locally initiated vasomotor responses along the arteriole which are termed conducted responses. Conducted dilations are initiated by the application of endothelium-dependent stimuli which result in local hyperpolarization. This signal spreads along the wall, most likely along the endothelial cell layer, to elicit a coordinated dilation of the arteriole over a considerable distance. Likewise, the opposite signal (depolarization) spreads along the vessel giving rise to a conducted constriction. The latter response is however most likely transmitted along the smooth muscle cell layer. Thus, conducted responses reflect the synchronized behavior of the cells of the vascular wall. It is assumed that conducted responses are critical for the matching of oxygen delivery and tissue needs because they contribute to an ascending dilation which lowers resistance along the length of the arterioles and upstream vessels in a well-tuned fashion. Herein, Cx40 is of special importance because it is critically required for intact signal transduction along the endothelial cell layer. In addition, Cx40 mediates pressure feedback inhibition on renin synthesis in the kidney. Both, vascular and renal function of Cx40, may be involved in the hypertension that is observed in Cx40-deficient animals. In this review, we will summarize physiologic function of connexins in arterioles and briefly address their role in the kidney with respect to renin secretion.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe novel neurological manifestations associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) autoimmunity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study (1987-2003) describes 62 patients Incidentally found to have a serum autoantibody that bound selectively to synapse-rich central nervous system tissues. The immunostaining pattern was determined to be GAD65-specific by radiolmmunoprecipitation assay. These cases were identified among samples submitted for paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation using indirect immunofluorescence. In no case had GAD65 or any other islet cell antibody testing been requested. RESULTS: In most cases, the patients' presentations were initially considered neurodegenerative or inflammatory (multiple sclerosis or paraneoplastic). Median age at onset was 50 years, and 77{\%} were women. Of the 44 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic, 23{\%} were African American; in contrast, less than 10{\%} of Mayo Clinic's neurology patients are African American. Median follow-up was 24 months. The radioimmunoprecipitation assay values for GAD65 antibody were extremely high (median, 1429 nmol/L; Interquartile range, 643-3078 nmol/L) and correlated significantly with immunofluorescence titers (median, 3840; interquartile range, 1920-15,360; r = 0.81; P {\textless}.001). Neurological manifestations were multifocal in 41 patients and included cerebellar ataxia (63{\%}), brainstem involvement (29{\%}), seizures (27{\%}), stiff-man phenomena (26{\%}), extrapyramidal signs (16{\%}), and myelopathy (8{\%}). One third of the patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 53{\%} had thyroid autoantibodies, and 16{\%} had vitiligo. Eleven of 20 patients identified as African American had brainstem involvement. Some patients appeared to benefit from short-term immunosuppression (none received long-term therapy). CONCLUSIONS: The neurological spectrum of GAD65 autoimmunity includes brainstem, extrapyramidal, and spinal cord syndromes. In our experience, African American patients were disproportionately affected. A patient with a presumed neurodegenerative disorder of new onset, with high levels of GAD65 antibody ({\textgreater}20 nmol/L), merits consideration of immunotherapy.},

This study investigated for the first time effects of medication on both components. Visually evoked potentials and resultant hemodynamic responses were assessed in Alzheimer patients (n=31) without vascular lesions in a MRI scan and compared to controls (n=20). After baseline recordings (AD0) tests were repeated under 2x1.5 to 2x3mg (AD1) and 2x4.5 to 2x6mg (AD2) rivastigmine/d. Long-term effects were investigated under 6 months of medication (AD2L). The ADAS, MMSE and DEMTECT were used to assess cognitive function at AD0, AD2 and AD2L. Improvement in vasoregulative function was independent from changes in evoked potentials. Acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors demonstrate substantial vascular effects in humans, which are independent from changes in neuronal function.},

	Abstract = {The ER is a central element in Ca(2+) signaling, both as a modulator of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and as a locus of Ca(2+)-regulated events. During surface membrane depolarization in excitable cells, the ER may either accumulate or release net Ca(2+), but the conditions of stimulation that determine which form of net Ca(2+) transport occurs are not well understood. The direction of net ER Ca(2+) transport depends on the relative rates of Ca(2+) uptake and release via distinct pathways that are differentially regulated by Ca(2+), so we investigated these rates and their sensitivity to Ca(2+) using sympathetic neurons as model cells. The rate of Ca(2+) uptake by SERCAs (J(SERCA)), measured as the t-BuBHQ-sensitive component of the total cytoplasmic Ca(2+) flux, increased monotonically with [Ca(2+)](i). Measurement of the rate of Ca(2+) release (J(Release)) during t-BuBHQ-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients made it possible to characterize the Ca(2+) permeability of the ER (({\~{}})P(ER)), describing the activity of all Ca(2+)-permeable channels that contribute to passive ER Ca(2+) release, including ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) release channels (RyRs) that are responsible for CICR. Simulations based on experimentally determined descriptions of J(SERCA), and of Ca(2+) extrusion across the plasma membrane (J(pm)) accounted for our previous finding that during weak depolarization, the ER accumulates Ca(2+), but at a rate that is attenuated by activation of a CICR pathway operating in parallel with SERCAs to regulate net ER Ca(2+) transport. Caffeine greatly increased the [Ca(2+)] sensitivity of (({\~{}})P(ER)), accounting for the effects of caffeine on depolarization-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) elevations and caffeine-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. Extending the rate descriptions of J(SERCA), (({\~{}})P(ER)), and J(pm) to higher [Ca(2+)](i) levels shows how the interplay between Ca(2+) transport systems with different Ca(2+) sensitivities accounts for the different modes of CICR over different ranges of [Ca(2+)](i) during stimulation.},

	Abstract = {Reduced activity of brain {\$}\alpha{\$}-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) occurs in a number of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In order to quantify the relation between diminished KGDHC activity and the mitochondrial ATP generation, redox state, transmembrane potential, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the respiratory chain (RC), we developed a detailed kinetic model. Model simulations revealed a threshold-like decline of the ATP production rate at about 60{\%} inhibition of KGDHC accompanied by a significant increase of the mitochondrial membrane potential. By contrast, progressive inhibition of the enzyme aconitase had only little impact on these mitochondrial parameters. As KGDHC is susceptible to ROS-dependent inactivation, we also investigated the reduction state of those sites of the RC proposed to be involved in ROS production. The reduction state of all sites except one decreased with increasing degree of KGDHC inhibition suggesting an ROS-reducing effect of KGDHC inhibition. Our model underpins the important role of reduced KGDHC activity in the energetic breakdown of neuronal cells during development of neurodegenerative diseases.},

	Abstract = {Brain edema and associated increased intracranial pressure are major consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). An important early component of the edema associated with TBI is astrocyte swelling (cytotoxic edema). Mechanisms for such swelling, however, are poorly understood. Ion channels/transporters/exchangers play a major role in cell volume regulation, and a disturbance in one or more of these systems may result in cell swelling. To examine potential mechanisms in TBI-mediated brain edema, we employed a fluid percussion model of in vitro barotrauma and examined the role of the ion transporter Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-)-cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) in trauma-induced astrocyte swelling as this transporter has been strongly implicated in the mechanism of cell swelling in various neurological conditions. Cultures exposed to trauma (3, 4, 5 atm pressure) caused a significant increase in NKCC1 activity (21{\%}, 42{\%}, 110{\%}, respectively) at 3 h. At 5 atm pressure, trauma significantly increased NKCC1 activity at 1 h and it remained increased for up to 3 h. Trauma also increased the phosphorylation (activation) of NKCC1 at 1 and 3 h. Inhibition of MAPKs and oxidative/nitrosative stress diminished the trauma-induced NKCC1 phosphorylation as well as its activity. Bumetanide, an inhibitor of NKCC1, significantly reduced the trauma-induced astrocyte swelling (61{\%}). Silencing NKCC1 with siRNA led to a reduction in trauma-induced NKCC1 activity as well as in cell swelling. These findings demonstrate the critical involvement of NKCC1 in the astrocyte swelling following in vitro trauma, and suggest that blocking NKCC1 activity may represent a useful therapeutic strategy for the cytotoxic brain edema associated with the early phase of TBI.},

	Abstract = {The endothelial lining of blood vessels is subjected to a wide range of haemodynamically-generated shear-stress forces throughout the vascular system. In vivo and in vitro, endothelial cells change their morphology and biochemistry in response to shear stress in a force- and time-dependent way, or when a critical threshold is exceeded. The initial stimulus-response coupling mechanisms have not been identified, however. Recently, Lansman et al. described stretch-activated ion channels in endothelial cells and suggested that they could be involved in the response to mechanical forces generated by blood flow. The channels were relatively nonselective and were opened by membrane stretching induced by suction. Here we report whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of single arterial endothelial cells exposed to controlled levels of laminar shear stress in capillary flow tubes. A K+ selective, shear-stress-activated ionic current (designated Ik.s) was identified which is unlike previously described stretch-activated currents. Ik.s varies in magnitude and duration as a function of shear stress (half-maximal effect at 0.70 dyn cm-2), desensitizes slowly and recovers rapidly and fully on cessation of flow. Ik.s activity represents the earliest and fastest stimulus-response coupling of haemodynamic forces to endothelial cells yet found. We suggest that localized flow-activated hyperpolarization of endothelium involving Ik.s may participate in the regulation of vascular tone.},

@article{Silver1996,
	Abstract = {1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp from granule cells in slices of rat cerebellum. EPSCs from individual mossy fibre inputs were identified by their all-or-none appearance in response to a graded stimulus. Excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated at room temperature (approximately 24 degrees C) and at near-physiological temperature (approximately 34 degrees C) by analysing current fluctuations in the peak and decay of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) component of EPSCs. 2. In a subset of synapses the mean EPSC amplitude remained unchanged as the probability of transmitter release was substantially lowered by raising the extracellular Mg2+ and lowering Ca2+. These synapses were considered to have only one functional release site. Single-site synapses had small EPSCs (139 16 pS, n = 5, at 24 degrees C) with a large coefficient of variation (c.v. = 0.23 0.02, n = 5) and an amplitude distribution that was well fitted by a Gaussian distribution in four out of five cases. The EPSC latency had a unimodal distribution and its standard deviation had a temperature dependence with a temperature coefficient (Q10; range, 24-35 degrees C) of 2.4 0.4 (n = 4). 3. Peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis of single-site EPSCs indicated that the mean conductance of the underlying non-NMDA channels was 12 2 pS (n = 4) at 35 degrees C. Upper and lower limits for mean channel open probability (Po), calculated from fluctuations in the EPSC peak amplitude, were 0.51 and 0.38, respectively. These estimates, together with the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter, suggest that only about 50{\%} of the non-NMDA channels were occupied following the release of a quantum of transmitter. 4. At some multi-site synapses EPSCs had a low c.v. (0.4 0.01, n = 5) at 34 degrees C and non-stationary fluctuation analysis gave a parabolic variance-mean current relationship. This suggests that practically all of the non-NMDA receptors were occupied by glutamate at the peak of EPSC. The channel open probability (Po = 0.84 0.03, n = 5) at these 'saturated' multi-site synapses will therefore equal the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter (Po,max). 5. Non-stationary fluctuation analysis of EPSCs from 'saturating' multi-site synapses indicated that 170 40 postsynaptic non-NMDA channels were exposed to transmitter at the peak of the EPSC. The mean conductance of the synaptic channels was 10 2 pS (n = 5) at 34 degrees C. 6. At synapses with multiple release sites the EPSC decay time became faster when release probability was lowered (by reducing the external Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio), indicating that the transmitter concentration profile depended on release probability. No such speeding of the EPSC decay was observed at single-site synapses. 7. Our results suggest that release of a packet of transmitter from a single release site does not saturate postsynaptic non-NMDA receptors at cerebellar mossy fibre-granule cell synapses. However, at multi-site synapses transmitter released from neighbouring sites can overlap, changing the transmitter concentration profile in the synaptic cleft. We conclude that the level of postsynaptic receptor occupancy can depend on the probability of transmitter release at individual multi-site synapses.},

	Abstract = {Over the past 20. years much attention has been given to characterizing the spatial accuracy of fMRI based signals and to techniques that improve on its co-localization with neuronal activity. While the vast majority of fMRI studies have always used the conventional positive BOLD signal, alternative contrast options have demonstrated superior spatial specificity. One of these options surfaced shortly after the initial BOLD fMRI demonstrations and was motivated by optical imaging studies which revealed an early signal change that was much smaller but spatially more specific than the delayed positive response. This early signal change was attributed to oxygenation changes prior to any subsequent blood flow increases. After observation of this biphasic hemodynamic response in fMRI, because this early response resulted in a small MR signal decrease prior to the onset of the large signal increase, it became known as the "initial dip". While the initial dip in fMRI was subsequently reported by many studies, including those in humans, monkeys, and cats, there were conflicting views about the associated mechanisms and whether it could be generalized across brain regions or species, in addition to whether or not it would prove fruitful for neuroscience. These discrepancies, along with the implications that the initial dip might increase the spatial specificity of BOLD fMRI from 2 to 3. mm to something more closely associated with neural activity, resulted in lot of buzz and controversy in the community for many years. In this review, the authors provide an account of the story of the initial dip in MR based functional imaging from the Minnesota perspective, where the first demonstrations, characterizations, and applications of the initial dip commenced. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {To electronically simulate an animal nerve axon, the authors made an active pulse transmission line using tunnel diodes. The equation of propagation for this line is the same as that for a simplified model of nerve membrane treated elsewhere. This line shapes the signal waveform during transmission, that is, there being a specific pulse-like waveform peculiar to this line, smaller signals are amplified, larger ones are attenuated, narrower ones are widened and those which are wider are shrunk, all approaching the above-mentioned specific waveform. In addition, this line has a certain threshold value in respect to the signal height, and signals smaller than the threshold or noise are eliminated in the course of transmission. Because of the above-mentioned shaping action and the existence of a threshold, this line makes possible highly reliable pulse transmission, and will be useful for various kinds of information-processing systems.},

In vivo electrophysiological data have shown that a prior depolarization of SONs induced a short-term (II sec) increase in their membrane excitability, which facilitated the ability of corticostriatal synaptic potentials to induce firing. Here we propose, using a computational model of SONs, that the use-dependent, short-term increase in the responsiveness of SONs mainly results from the slow kinetics of a voltage-dependent, slowly inactivating potassium A-current. This mechanism confers on SONs a form of intrinsic short-term memory that optimizes the synaptic input-output relationship as a function of their past activation.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a key mediator in the mechanisms of ischaemic tolerance induced by a wide variety of preconditioning stimuli. NO is involved in the brain protection that develops either early (minutes-hours) or late (days-weeks) after the preconditioning stimulus. However, the sources of NO and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects differ substantially. While in early preconditioning NO is produced by the endothelial and neuronal isoform of NO synthase, in delayed preconditioning NO is synthesized by the inducible or 'immunological' isoform of NO synthase. Furthermore, in early preconditioning, NO acts through the canonical cGMP pathway, possibly through protein kinase G and opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels. In late preconditioning, the protection is mediated by peroxynitrite formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide derived from the enzyme NADPH oxidase. The mechanisms by which peroxynitrite exerts its protective effect may include improvement of post-ischaemic cerebrovascular function, leading to enhancement of blood flow to the ischaemic territory, and expression of prosurvival genes resulting in cytoprotection. The evidence suggests that NO can engage highly effective and multifunctional prosurvival pathways, which could be exploited for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies.},

Complex cerebrovascular control mechanisms ensure that active brain regions receive an adequate amount of blood, but the nature of these mechanisms remains elusive. Recent findings implicate perivascular neurons, gliovascular interactions and intramural vascular signalling in the control of the cerebral microcirculation. Neurons, astrocytes and vascular cells seem to constitute a functional unit, the primary purpose of which is to maintain the homeostasis of the brain's microenvironment. Alterations of these vascular regulatory mechanisms lead to brain dysfunction and disease. The emerging view is that cerebrovascular dysregulation is a feature not only of cerebrovascular pathologies, such as stroke, but also of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease.},

However, advances made recently in the theory of generic excitable media suggest that an additional factor - the geometry of excitation wavefronts - may play an important role. In particular, impulse propagation strongly depends on the wavefront curvature on a small spatial scale. In the heart, excitation wavefronts have pronounced curvatures in several situations including waves initiated by small electrodes, waves emerging from narrow tissue structures, and waves propagating around the sharp edges of anatomical obstacles or around a zone of functional conduction block during spiral wave rotation. In this short review we consider the theoretical background relating impulse propagation to wavefront curvature and we estimate the role of wavefront curvature in electrical stimulation, formation of conduction block, and the dynamic behavior of spiral waves.},

	Abstract = {In cerebral ischemia survival of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells is threatened during energy deprivation and/or following re-supply of oxygen and glucose. After a brief summary of characteristics of different cells types, emphasizing the dependence of all on oxidative metabolism, the bioenergetics of focal and global ischemia is discussed, distinguishing between events during energy deprivation and subsequent recovery attempt after re-circulation. Gray and white matter ischemia are described separately, and distinctions are made between mature and immature brains. Next comes a description of bioenergetics in individual cell types in culture during oxygen/glucose deprivation or exposure to metabolic inhibitors and following re-establishment of normal aerated conditions. Due to their expression of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors neurons and oligodendrocytes are exquisitely sensitive to excitotoxicity by glutamate, which reaches high extracellular concentrations in ischemic brain for several reasons, including failing astrocytic uptake. Excitotoxicity kills brain cells by energetic exhaustion (due to Na+ extrusion after channel-mediated entry) combined with mitochondrial Ca2+-mediated injury and formation of reactive oxygen species. Many (but not all) astrocytes survive energy deprivation for extended periods, but after return to aerated conditions they are vulnerable to mitochondrial damage by cytoplasmic/mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and to NAD+ deficiency. Ca2+ overload is established by reversal of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers following Na+ accumulation during Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter stimulation or pH regulation, compensating for excessive acid production. NAD+ deficiency inhibits glycolysis and eventually oxidative metabolism, secondary to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) activity following DNA damage. Hyperglycemia can be beneficial for neurons but increases astrocytic death due to enhanced acidosis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Imaging of scattered and reflected light from the surface of neural structures can reveal the functional architecture within large populations of neurons. These techniques exploit, as one of the principal signal sources, reflectance changes produced by local variation in blood volume and oxygen saturation related to neural activity. We found that a major source of variability in the captured light signal is a pervasive low-frequency (0.1-Hz) oscillation which apparently results from regional cerebral blood flow. This signal is present in brain parenchyma as well as the microvasculature and exhibits many characteristics of the low-frequency "vasomotion" signals observed in peripheral microcirculation. Concurrent measurements in brain with a laser Doppler flow meter contained an almost identical low-frequency signal. The presence of the 0.1-Hz oscillation in the cerebral microcirculation could underlie a portion of the previously described characteristics reported in reflected-light imaging studies. The prevalence of the oscillatory phenomena in the brain raises substantial temporal sampling issues for optical imaging and for other visualization techniques which depend on changes in regional cerebral blood dynamics, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nitric oxide-induced vasodilatation is mediated by both cGMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Previous studies that examined the role of soluble guanylyl cyclase in cerebral vessels have used methylene blue and LY-83583, compounds that generate superoxide anion and are not specific for inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase. We examined the effects of ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one), a novel and highly selective inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, on responses of cerebral arterioles. METHODS: The effects of ODQ on responses of cerebral arterioles to acetylcholine, nitroprusside, 8-bromo-cGMP, and adenosine were examined in anesthetized mice by means of a cranial window. The effects of two concentrations of ODQ were examined in the absence and presence of superoxide dismutase. The effects of NG-nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, were also tested. RESULTS: ODQ (3 and 10 mumol/L) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of dilatation of cerebral arterioles (control diameter = 29 +/- 1 microns) (mean +/- SE) in response to acetylcholine and nitroprusside. For example, 10 mumol/L acetylcholine and 1 mumol/L nitroprusside dilated cerebral arterioles by 28 +/- 3{\%} and 44 +/- 2{\%} in the absence and 6 +/- 2{\%} and 7 +/- 1{\%}, respectively, in the presence of 10 mumol/L ODQ (P {\textless}.05 versus control). The inhibitory effects of ODQ were not altered by superoxide dismutase. Vasodilatation in response to 8-bromo-cGMP and adenosine was not inhibited by ODQ. NG-Nitro-L-arginine (100 mumol/L), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, inhibited responses to acetylcholine by approximately 80{\%} but tended to enhance responses to nitroprusside. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, nitric oxide-mediated dilatation of mouse cerebral arterioles is profoundly inhibited by ODQ, an inhibitor of activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Cerebral vasodilator responses to adenosine and 8-bromo-cGMP were preserved in the presence of ODQ, indicating that inhibition by ODQ was selective. In contrast to previously used inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase (methylene blue and LY-83583), the effects of ODQ are not mediated by generation of superoxide anion},

	Abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease, $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) plaques are surrounded by activated astrocytes and microglia. A growing body of evidence suggests that these activated glia contribute to neurotoxicity through the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) and the production of neurotoxic free radicals, mediated in part by the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). Here, we address the possibility that A$\beta$-stimulated iNOS expression might result from an initial induction of IL-1$\beta$ and TNF$\alpha$. We find that in A$\beta$-stimulated astrocyte cultures, IL-1$\beta$ and TNF$\alpha$ production occur before iNOS production, new protein synthesis is required for increased iNOS mRNA levels, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra can inhibit nitrite accumulation. Likewise, dominant-negative mutants of tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, TRAF2, and NF$\kappa$B-inducing kinase (NIK), intracellular proteins involved in IL-1 and TNF$\alpha$ receptor signaling cascades, inhibit A$\beta$-stimulated iNOS promoter activity. Our data suggest that A$\beta$ stimulation of astrocyte iNOS is mediated in part by IL-1$\beta$ and TNF$\alpha$, and involves a TRAF6-, TRAF2-, and NIK-dependent signaling mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of brain glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier is of importance to understanding brain energy metabolism. The specific kinetics of glucose transport have been generally described using standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These models predict that the steady-state glucose concentration approaches an upper limit in the human brain when the plasma glucose level is well above the Michaelis-Menten constant for half-maximal transport, Kt. In experiments where steady-state plasma glucose content was varied from 4 to 30 mM, the brain glucose level was a linear function of plasma glucose concentration. At plasma concentrations nearing 30 mM, the brain glucose level approached 9 mM, which was significantly higher than predicted from the previously reported Kt of approximately 4 mM (p {\textless} 0.05). The high brain glucose concentration measured in the human brain suggests that ablumenal brain glucose may compete with lumenal glucose for transport. We developed a model based on a reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetic formulation of unidirectional transport rates. Fitting this model to brain glucose level as a function of plasma glucose level gave a substantially lower Kt of 0.6 +/- 2.0 mM, which was consistent with the previously reported millimolar Km of GLUT-1 in erythrocyte model systems. Previously reported and reanalyzed quantification provided consistent kinetic parameters. We conclude that cerebral glucose transport is most consistently described when using reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics.},

@article{Brown2013,
	Abstract = {We consider approaches to the numerical difficulties posed by modelling resistive networks with dynamically changing resistances according to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The prototype problem is autoregulation on a cerebral microvascular network. In this network the amount of perfusion, or tissue blood supply, is determined by the resistance of the vascular network. This resistance can be dynamically altered to regulate the amount of blood flow and hence maintain a balance of chemicals and nutrients in the tissue. The mechanisms responsible for this are primarily local, and are due to various chemical pathways to the vascular smooth muscle cells lining the arterioles and arteries in the vasculature. These cells contract and dilate, which alters the radii and hence resistance of the vessels. Because of the global coupling induced by the resistive network, the resulting stiff system of odes has a dense Jacobian which precludes the direct application of traditional implicit numerical solution methods. We consider a means of remedying this problem by taking a block diagonal Jacobian approximation which allows use of an implicit method but retains the desirable property of explicit solvers of linear solution time scaling with problem size. {\textcopyright} Austral.

	Abstract = {Increases in neuronal activity cause an enhanced blood flow to the active brain area. This neurovascular coupling is regulated by multiple mechanisms: Adenosine and lactate produced as metabolic end-products couple activity with flow by inducing vasodilation. As a specific mechanism to the brain, synaptic activity-induced Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}increases in astrocytes, interneurons and neurons translate neuronal activity to vasoactive signals such as arachidonic acid metabolites and NO. K{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}released onto smooth muscle cells through Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-activated K{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}channels on end-feet can also induce vasodilation during neuronal activity. An intense communication between the endothelia, pericytes and astrocytes is required for development and functioning of the neurovascular unit as well as the BBB. The ratio of pericytes to endothelial cells is higher in the cerebral microcirculation than other tissues. Pericytes play a role in distribution of microvascular blood flow in response to the local demand as a final regulatory step after arterioles, which feed a larger cohort of cells. Pericyte-endothelial communication is essential for vasculogenesis. Pericyte also take part in leukocyte infiltration and immune responses. The microvascular injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion plays a critical role in tissue survival after recanalization by inducing sustained pericyte contraction and microcirculatory clogging (no-reflow) and by disrupting BBB integrity. Suppression of oxidative/nitrative stress or sustained adenosine delivery during re-opening of an occluded artery improves the outcome of recanalization by promoting microcirculatory reflow. Pericyte dysfunction in retinal microvessels is the main cause of diabetic retinopathy. Recent findings suggest that the age-related microvascular dysfunction may initiate the neurodegenerative changes seen Alzheimers dementia.

	Abstract = {A detailed nonlinear four-region (red blood cell, plasma, interstitial fluid, and parenchymal cell) axially distributed convection-diffusion-permeation-reaction-binding computational model is developed to study the simultaneous transport and exchange of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood-tissue exchange system of the heart. Since the pH variation in blood and tissue influences the transport and exchange of O2 and CO2 (Bohr and Haldane effects), and since most CO2 is transported as HCO3(-) (bicarbonate) via the CO2 hydration (buffering) reaction, the transport and exchange of HCO3(-) and H+ are also simulated along with that of O2 and CO2. Furthermore, the model accounts for the competitive nonlinear binding of O2 and CO2 with the hemoglobin inside the red blood cells (nonlinear O2-CO2 interactions, Bohr and Haldane effects), and myoglobin-facilitated transport of O2 inside the parenchymal cells. The consumption of O2 through cytochrome-c oxidase reaction inside the parenchymal cells is based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The corresponding production of CO2 is determined by respiratory quotient (RQ), depending on the relative consumption of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. The model gives a physiologically realistic description of O2 transport and metabolism in the microcirculation of the heart. Furthermore, because model solutions for tracer transients and steady states can be computed highly efficiently, this model may be the preferred vehicle for routine data analysis where repetitive solutions and parameter optimization are required, as is the case in PET imaging for estimating myocardial O2 consumption.},

We focused on the relationships between hemorheological alterations and cerebral TOI in sickle cell patients with no cerebral vasculopathy and on the usefulness of TOI variability to assess the cerebral vasomotion activity. The blood rheological profile, the level of cerebral TOI (spatial resolved spectroscopy) and the cerebral TOI variability, which reflects vasomotion activity, were compared between 20 healthy subjects (AA), 21 SC patients, and 21 SS patients. Cerebral TOI exhibited the following order: AA {\textgreater} SC {\textgreater} SS. The low cerebral TOI in SS patients was related to red blood cell aggregation and deformability properties. The cerebral TOI variability of SS and SC patients was increased above healthy values and vasomotion activity was negatively associated with the reduced cerebral TOI in SS patients. We demonstrated that (1) blood rheology could be involved in the reduced cerebral TOI in SS patients but not in SC patients; (2) vasomotion activity is increased in SS and SC patients to compensate for the reduced cerebral TOI.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular space (ECS) volume fraction (alpha), ECS tortuosity (lambda), and nonspecific uptake (k'), three parameters affecting the diffusion of substances in nervous tissue, were studied during ischemia and anoxia in the rat spinal cord gray matter in vivo. Progressive ischemia evoked by exsanguination, as well as anoxia evoked by respiratory or cardiac arrest, produced prominent extracellular K+ and pH changes closely related to a decrease in blood pressure and amplitude of field potentials. With use of ion-selective microelectrodes, the changes in the diffusion parameters were measured by quantitative analysis of concentration-time profiles of tetramethylammonium (TMA+) applied by iontophoresis concomitantly with ionic shifts. Under normoxic conditions (in rats with blood pressure of 80-110 mm Hg) diffusion parameters in the dorsal horn gray matter at depth 500-900 microns were as follows: alpha = 0.20 +/- 0.019, lambda = 1.62 +/- 0.12, k' = 4.6 +/- 2.5 x 10(-3) s-1 (mean +/- SD, n = 39). Extracellular K+, pH, and diffusion properties gradually changed during progressive ischemia. As the blood pressure fell to 50-60 mm Hg and field potential amplitude to 20-60{\%}, K+ rose to 6-12 mM, pHe fell by approximately 0.05-0.1 pH unit, and volume fraction of the ECS significantly decreased, to alpha = 0.16 +/- 0.019 (n = 22). Even though the tortuosity remained virtually constant, the nonspecific uptake significantly decreased to k' = 3.4 +/- 1.8 x 10(-3) s-1. As the blood pressure fell to 20-30 mm Hg and field potential amplitude to 0-6{\%}, K+ rose to 60-70 mM, pHe fell by approximately 0.6-0.8 pH unit, and all three diffusion parameters significantly changed. The ECS volume fraction decreased to alpha = 0.05 +/- 0.021, tortuosity increased to lambda = 2.00 +/- 0.24, and TMA+ uptake decreased to k' = 1.5 +/- 1.6 x 10(-3) s-1 (n = 12). No further increase in extracellular K+ or changes in the alpha were found during and up to 120 min after the death of the animal. However, there was a further significant increase in lambda = 2.20 +/- 0.14 and decrease in k' = 0.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3) s-1 (n = 24). The acid shift reached its maximum level at approximately 5-10 min after respiratory arrest and then the pHe gradually increased by approximately 0.2 unit. Full recovery to "normoxic" diffusion parameters was achieved after reinjection of the blood or after an injection of noradrenaline during severe ischemia, if this resulted in a rise in blood pressure above 80 mm Hg and a decrease in extracellular K+ below 12 mM.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes play an important role in regulating neuronal activity and local brain states, in part by serving as intermediaries between neurons and vasculature. We postulate that neurons and astrocytes are sensitive to biophysical conditions in their local environment, in addition to their participation in traditional signaling networks with other neurons. Mechanically sensitive astrocytic endfeet ensheathe cerebral blood vessels, which change size in order to regulate blood flow. We found that changes in local biophysical state caused by mechanical perturbations exerted through blood vessels can depolarize astrocytes and some neurons in slice. To test the hemoneural hypothesis in vivo, we developed a means of inducing dilation using the SUR2B receptor agonist pinacidil, which is specific to vascular smooth muscle. It was important to ascertain that pinacidil had no direct effect on astrocytes or neurons, and we confirmed this in whole cell recordings in cortical slices. We then used two-photon imaging to visualize astrocytic calcium dynamics in vivo while manipulating vasodilation in vivo. Pinacidil caused a 10-20{\%} dilation in most vessels, a degree of dilation of similar magnitude to those naturally evoked by persistent sensory stimulation (e.g. in fMRI studies). We found that increases in pial arteriole diameter could occasionally evoke traveling calcium waves in astrocytes. We also saw consistently slow increases (which took tens of seconds to onset, and persisted for minutes) in astrocytic calcium levels at both endfeet and soma in cortical layer 1, corresponding to vessel dilation. When vessels partially reconstricted due to pinacidil washout, calcium levels also showed a relative decrease. At short time scales (from 0.5 - 5 seconds) we saw strong correlations ({\textgreater}0.5) between small fluctuations in astrocytic calcium levels (1-3{\%}) and vessel diameter (1-3{\%}). Fluctuations in vessel diameter predicted similar fluctuations in astrocytic calcium, as often and as strongly as the reverse, suggesting feedback regulation between vascular diameter and astrocytic calcium activation levels.},

Using computer simulations, we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population synchronization, on properties of single cells and the circuit, were identified. These include the following: (1) that the amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the GABAA synaptic reversal potential; (2) that the ratio between the synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently large; (3) that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency--current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. Furthermore, using a population coherence measure, based on coincident firings of neural pairs, it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical (minimal) average number of synaptic contacts per cell, which is not sensitive to the network size.{\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}nBy changing the GABAA synaptic maximal conductance, synaptic decay time constant, or the mean external excitatory drive to the network, the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By contrast, the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma (20--80 Hz) range. We conclude that the GABAA synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In turn, the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons. },

	Abstract = {Recent epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, to investigate the pathophysiological interaction between these diseases, we generated animal models that reflect the pathologic conditions of both diseases. We crossed Alzheimer transgenic mice (APP23) with two types of diabetic mice (ob/ob and NSY mice), and analyzed their metabolic and brain pathology. The onset of diabetes exacerbated Alzheimer-like cognitive dysfunction without an increase in brain amyloid-beta burden in double-mutant (APP(+)-ob/ob) mice. Notably, APP(+)-ob/ob mice showed cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy. Conversely, the cross-bred mice showed an accelerated diabetic phenotype compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting that Alzheimer amyloid pathology could aggravate diabetes. Similarly, APP(+)-NSY fusion mice showed more severe glucose intolerance compared with diabetic NSY mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet feeding induced severe memory deficits in APP(+)-NSY mice without an increase in brain amyloid-beta load. Here, we created Alzheimer mouse models with early onset of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrovascular changes and alteration in brain insulin signaling might play a pivotal role in this relationship. These findings could provide insights into this intensely debated association.},

Cardiol. 92:59-61) has been proposed to be a regulator of calcium homeostasis and signal transduction networks of the cell. However, little is known about its precise mechanisms of action. Knock-out of (mainly neuronal) isoform 2 of the enzyme resulted in hearing loss and balance deficits due to severe inner ear defects, affecting formation and maintenance of otoconia (Kozel, P.J., R.A. Friedman, L.C. Erway, E.N. Yamoah, L.H. Liu, T. Riddle, J.J. Duffy, T. Doetschman, M.L. Miller, E.L. Cardell, and G.E. Shull. 1998. J. Biol. Chem. 273:18693-18696). Here we demonstrate that PMCA 4b is a negative regulator of nitric oxide synthase I (NOS-I, nNOS) in HEK293 embryonic kidney and neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell models. Binding of PMCA 4b to NOS-I was mediated by interaction of the COOH-terminal amino acids of PMCA 4b and the PDZ domain of NOS-I (PDZ: PSD 95/Dlg/ZO-1 protein domain). Increasing expression of wild-type PMCA 4b (but not PMCA mutants unable to bind PDZ domains or devoid of Ca2+-transporting activity) dramatically downregulated NO synthesis from wild-type NOS-I. A NOS-I mutant lacking the PDZ domain was not regulated by PMCA, demonstrating the specific nature of the PMCA-NOS-I interaction. Elucidation of PMCA as an interaction partner and major regulator of NOS-I provides evidence for a new dimension of integration between calcium and NO signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {We describe a method for imaging the local cortical haemodynamic response to whisker stimulation in the rat without use of anaesthetic or paralytic agents. Female Hooded Lister rats were anaesthetised and a section of skull overlying somatosensory cortex thinned to translucency. A stainless steel chamber was then secured over the thin cranial window. Following recovery, animals were supported in a harness whilst the head was held by the implanted chamber using a pneumatically driven clamp. Optical imaging and optical imaging spectroscopy (OIS) of somatosensory cortex were performed whilst the contralateral whiskers were stimulated using a computer controlled air-puffer. Imaging sessions lasted approximately 15 min and data were collected for at least three consecutive days. Experiments were then repeated with the animals under urethane anaesthesia. Spectral analysis revealed qualitatively similar haemodynamic response functions across both anaesthetic states. However, our results indicate that the cortical haemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulation is larger by a factor of ∼5 in the unanaesthetised rat compared with the anaesthetised rat. This preparation may make possible the investigation of the haemodynamic correlates of a broad range of neurological processes in the awake, behaving rodent. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {Rapid action potential generation - spiking - and alternating intervals of spiking and quiescence - bursting - are two dynamic patterns commonly observed in neuronal activity. In computational models of neuronal systems, the transition from spiking to bursting often exhibits complex bifurcation structure. One type of transition involves the torus canard, which we show arises in a broad array of well-known computational neuronal models with three different classes of bursting dynamics: sub-Hopf/fold cycle bursting, circle/fold cycle bursting, and fold/fold cycle bursting. The essential features that these models share are multiple time scales leading naturally to decomposition into slow and fast systems, a saddle-node of periodic orbits in the fast system, and a torus bifurcation in the full system. We show that the transition from spiking to bursting in each model system is given by an explosion of torus canards. Based on these examples, as well as on emerging theory, we propose that torus canards are a common dynamic phenomenon separating the regimes of spiking and bursting activity.},

	Abstract = {Local increases in neuronal activity within the brain lead to dilation of blood vessels and to increased regional cerebral blood flow. Increases in extracellular potassium concentration are known to dilate cerebral arterioles. Recent studies have suggested that the potassium released by active neurons is transported through astrocytic glial cells and released from their endfeet onto blood vessels. The results of computer simulations of potassium dynamics in the brain indicate that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet raises perivascular potassium concentration much more rapidly and to higher levels than does diffusion of potassium through extracellular space, particularly when the site of a potassium increase is some distance from the vessel wall. On the basis of this finding, it is proposed that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet plays an important role in regulating regional cerebral blood flow in response to changes in neuronal activity.},

	Abstract = {To study the effect of myoendothelial communication on vascular reactivity, we integrated detailed mathematical models of Ca(2+) dynamics and membrane electrophysiology in arteriolar smooth muscle (SMC) and endothelial (EC) cells. Cells are coupled through the exchange of Ca(2+), Cl(-), K(+), and Na(+) ions, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)), and the paracrine diffusion of nitric oxide (NO). EC stimulation reduces intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in the SMC by transmitting a hyperpolarizing current carried primarily by K(+). The NO-independent endothelium-derived hyperpolarization was abolished in a synergistic-like manner by inhibition of EC SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels. During NE stimulation, IP(3) diffusing from the SMC induces EC Ca(2+) release, which, in turn, moderates SMC depolarization and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. On the contrary, SMC [Ca(2+)](i) was not affected by EC-derived IP(3). Myoendothelial Ca(2+) fluxes had no effect in either cell. The EC exerts a stabilizing effect on calcium-induced calcium release-dependent SMC Ca(2+) oscillations by increasing the norepinephrine concentration window for oscillations. We conclude that a model based on independent data for subcellular components can capture major features of the integrated vessel behavior. This study provides a tissue-specific approach for analyzing complex signaling mechanisms in the vasculature.},

This work reports results from three empirical tests that support this hypothesis. First, fMRI responses in human primary visual cortex (V1) depend separably on stimulus timing and stimulus contrast. Second, responses to long-duration stimuli can be predicted from responses to shorter duration stimuli. Third, the noise in the fMRI data is independent of stimulus contrast and temporal period. Although these tests can not prove the correctness of the linear transform model, they might have been used to reject the model. Because the linear transform model is consistent with our data, we proceeded to estimate the temporal fMRI impulse--response function and the underlying (presumably neural) contrast--response function of human V1.},

	Abstract = {We propose a mechanism for agonist-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations that involves two roles for cytosolic Ca2+: (a) inhibition of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) stimulated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and (b) stimulation of the production of IP3 through its action on phospholipase C (PLC), via a Gq protein related mechanism. Relying on quantitative experiments by Parker, I., and I. Ivorra (1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87:260-264) on the inhibition of Ca2+ release from the ER using caged-IP3, we develop a kinetic model of inhibition that allows us to simulate closely their experiments. The model assumes that the ER IP3 receptor is a tetramer of independent subunits that can bind both Ca2+ and IP3. Upon incorporation of the action of Ca2+ on PLC that leads to production of IP3, we observe in-phase-oscillations of Ca2+ and IP3 at intermediate values of agonist stimulation. The oscillations occur on a time scale of 10-20 s, which is comparable to the time scale for inhibition in Xenopus oocytes. Analysis of the mechanism shows that Ca(2+)-inhibition of IP3-stimulated Ca2+ release from the ER is an essential step in the mechanism. We also find that the effect of Ca2+ on PLC can lead to an indirect increase of cytosolic Ca2+, superficially resembling "Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release." The mechanism that we propose appears to be consistent with recent experiments on REF52 cells by Harootunian, A. T., J. P. Y. Kao, S. Paranjape, and R. Y. Tsien. (1991. Science [Wash. DC]. 251:75-78.) and we propose additional experiments to help test its underlying assumptions.},

	Abstract = {In agreement with optical imaging studies, previous fMRI studies have reported an initial decrease (i.e. the initial dip) in the BOLD response, which is believed to arise from an increase in oxygen consumption and to be mostly microvascular. To date, experimental studies of the initial dip in humans have been performed at fields up to 4 T, with relatively low spatial resolution. Because the sensitivity to microvascular contribution is increased at high magnetic fields, the present study investigated the initial dip at 7 T. In addition, to reduce the partial volume effect, the study is conducted at a high spatial resolution. The initial dip was detected in all subjects studied and was found to reside mostly in the gray matter. The relative amplitude of the early response was found to be 0.6, higher than that at 4 T (0.3) and 1.5 T (0.11). In addition, based on the assumption that the initial dip is a result of increased oxygen utilization, the fractional change in oxygen utilization was estimated to be 40{\%} of that of the fractional change in cerebral blood flow. These results are in agreement with the notion that the initial dip arises from an increase in oxygen consumption.},

To allow for investigations of the effects of channel pathologies, channel blockers and ion concentrations on macroscopic activity, we formulate neural mass equations explicitly incorporating the single cell dynamics by using a bottom-up approach. The mean and variance of the firing rate and synaptic input distributions are modeled. The firing rate curve (F(I)-curve) is used as link between the single cell and macroscopic dynamics.

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous lipophilic free radical cellular messenger generated by three distinct isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS). NO plays an important role in the protection against the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is associated with a number of different disorders including hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and diabetes. The underlying pathology for most cardiovascular diseases is atherosclerosis, which is in turn associated with endothelial dysfunctional. The cardioprotective roles of NO include regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion, and prevention smooth muscle cell proliferation. Reduced bioavailability of NO is thought to be one of the central factors common to cardiovascular disease, although it is unclear whether this is a cause of, or result of, endothelial dysfunction. Disturbances in NO bioavailability leads to a loss of the cardio protective actions and in some case may even increase disease progression. In this chapter the cellular and biochemical mechanisms leading to reduced NO bioavailability are discussed and evidence for the prevalence of these mechanisms in cardiovascular disease evaluated. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Many cells exhibit periodic transient increases in cytosolic calcium levels rather than a sustained rise when stimulated by a hormone or growth factor. We propose here a molecular model that accounts for periodic calcium spiking induced by a constant stimulus. Four elements give rise to repetitive calcium transients: cooperativity and positive feedback between a pair of reciprocally coupled (crosscoupled) messengers, followed by deactivation and then by reactivation. The crosscoupled messengers in our model are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and cytosolic calcium ions. The opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum by the binding of multiple molecules of InsP3 provides the required cooperativity. The stimulation of receptor-activated phospholipase C by released calcium ions leads to positive feedback. InsP3 is destroyed by a phosphatase, and calcium ion is pumped back into the endoplasmic reticulum. These processes generate bistability: the cytosolic calcium concentration abruptly increases from a basal level to a stimulated level at a threshold degree of activation of phospholipase C. Spiking further requires slow deactivation and subsequent reactivation. In our model, mitochondrial sequestration of calcium ion prevents the cytosolic level from increasing above several micromolar and enables the system to return to the basal state. When the endoplasmic reticulum calcium store is refilled to a critical level by the Ca2+-ATPase pump, cooperative positive feedback between the InsP3-gated channel and phospholipase C begins again to give the next calcium spike. The time required for the calcium level in the endoplasmic reticulum to reach a threshold sets the interval between spikes. The amplitude, shape, and period of calcium spikes calculated for this model are like those observed experimentally.},

	Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in neuron--glia communication. This interest stems from the realization that glia participate in cognitive functions and information processing and are involved in many brain disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. An important process in neuron--glia communications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer---the modulation of intracellular calcium (Ca2 + ) dynamics in astrocytes in response to synaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model for glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca2 + dynamics that captures the essential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Starting from the well-known two-variable (intracellular Ca2 + and inactive IP3 receptors) Li--Rinzel model for calcium-induced calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of IP3 production and phosphorylation. Doing so, we extend it to a three-variable model (which we refer to as the ChI model) that could account for Ca2 + oscillations with endogenous IP3 metabolism. This ChI model is then further extended into the G-ChI model to include regulation of IP3 production by external glutamate signals. Compared with previous similar models, our three-variable models include a more realistic description of IP3 production and degradation pathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise formulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate the existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between IP3 and Ca2 + pathways endow the system with self-consistent oscillatory properties and favor mixed frequency--amplitude encoding modes over pure amplitude--modulation ones. These and additional results of our model are in general agreement with available experimental data and may have important implications for the role of astrocytes in the synaptic transfer of information.},

@article{Dupont1994,
	Abstract = {Cytosolic Ca2+ waves occur in a number of cell types either spontaneously or after stimulation by hormones, neurotransmitters, or treatments promoting Ca2+ influx into the cells. These waves can be broadly classified into two types. Waves of type 1, observed in cardiac myocytes or Xenopus oocytes, correspond to the propagation of sharp bands of Ca2+ throughout the cell at a rate that is high enough to permit the simultaneous propagation of several fronts in a given cells. Waves of type 2, observed in hepatocytes, endothelial cells, or various kinds of eggs, correspond to the progressive elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ throughout the cell, followed by its quasi-homogeneous return down to basal levels. Here we analyze the propagation of these different types of intracellular Ca2+ waves in a model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). The model accounts for transient or sustained waves of type 1 or 2, depending on the size of the cell and on the values of the kinetic parameters that measure Ca2+ exchange between the cytosol, the extracellular medium, and intracellular stores. Two versions of the model based on CICR are considered. The first version involves two distinct Ca2+ pools sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+, respectively, whereas the second version involves a single pool sensitive both to Ca2+ and IP3 behaving as co-agonists for Ca2+ release. Intracellular Ca2+ waves occur in the two versions of the model based on CICR, but fail to propagate in the one-pool model at subthreshold levels of IP3. For waves of type 1, we investigate the effect of the spatial distribution of Ca(2+)-sensitive Ca2+ stores within the cytosol, and show that the wave fails to propagate when the distance between the stores exceeds a critical value on the order of a few microns. We also determine how the period and velocity of the waves are affected by changes in parameters measuring stimulation, Ca2+ influx into the cell, or Ca2+ pumping into the stores. For waves of type 2, the numerical analysis indicates that the best qualitative agreement with experimental observations is obtained for phase waves. Finally, conditions are obtained for the occurrence of "echo" waves that are sometimes observed in the experiments.},

Purkinje cells responded with large inward currents accompanied by increases in dendritic [Ca2+]i, when challenged with the excitatory amino acid agonists glutamate and quisqualate. The rise in [Ca2+]i was transient and reached peak values of several hundred nanomolar. The response subsisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, a condition that eliminates Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, indicating that Ca2+ arose in large part from an intracellular compartment. In support of this hypothesis, only the first agonist application elicited a [Ca2+]i increase in slices maintained in Ca 2+-free medium, as expected if the intracellular stores become depleted. These results indicate that metabotropic glutamate receptors are functional in Purkinje cells and point to glutamate as a possible modulator of [Ca2+]i in these neurons.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) result from the degeneration of synapses and neuronal death in the limbic system and associated regions of the cerebral cortex. An alteration in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in increased production and accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain. Abeta can render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis by disruption of cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and neurotoxic factors including reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and cytokines. Many lines of evidence have suggested that transient receptor potential (TRP) channels consisting of six main subfamilies termed the TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), and TRPA (ankyrin) are involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis disruption. Thus, emerging evidence of the pathophysiological role of TRP channels has yielded promising candidates for molecular entities mediating Ca(2+) homeostasis disruption in AD. In this review, we focus on the TRP channels in AD and highlight some TRP "suspects" for which a role in AD can be anticipated. An understanding of the involvement of TRP channels in AD may lead to the development of new target therapies},

	Abstract = {Protein kinase C-potentiated phosphatase inhibitor of 17 kDa (CPI-17) mediates some agonist-induced smooth muscle contraction by suppressing the myosin phosphatase in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The physiologically relevant kinases that phosphorylate CPI-17 remain to be identified. Several previous studies have shown that some agonist-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation in smooth muscle tissues was attenuated by the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632, suggesting that ROCK is involved in agonist-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation. However, Y-27632 has recently been found to inhibit protein kinase C (PKC)-delta, a well-recognized CPI-17 kinase. Thus the role of ROCK in agonist-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation remains uncertain. The present study was designed to address this important issue. We selectively activated the RhoA pathway using inducible adenovirus-mediated expression of a constitutively active mutant RhoA (V14RhoA) in primary cultured rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). V14RhoA caused expression level-dependent CPI-17 phosphorylation at Thr38 as well as myosin phosphatase phosphorylation at Thr853. Importantly, we have shown that V14RhoA-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation was not affected by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X but was abolished by Y-27632, suggesting that ROCK but not PKC was involved. Furthermore, we have shown that the contractile agonists thrombin and U-46619 induced CPI-17 phosphorylation in VSMCs. Similarly to V14RhoA-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation, thrombin-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation was not affected by inhibition of PKC with GF109203X, but it was blocked by inhibition of RhoA with adenovirus-mediated expression of exoenzyme C3 as well as by Y-27632. Taken together, our present data provide the first clear evidence indicating that ROCK is responsible for thrombin- and U-46619-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation in primary cultured VSMCs.},

	Abstract = {The diffusion of neuroactive substances in the extracellular space (ECS) plays an important role in short- and long-distance communication between nerve cells and is the underlying mechanism of extrasynaptic (volume) transmission. The diffusion properties of the ECS are described by three parameters: 1. ECS volume fraction alpha (alpha=ECS volume/total tissue volume), 2. tortuosity lambda (lambda2=free/apparent diffusion coefficient), reflecting the presence of diffusion barriers represented by, e.g., fine neuronal and glial processes or extracellular matrix molecules and 3. nonspecific uptake k'. These diffusion parameters differ in various brain regions, and diffusion in the CNS is therefore inhomogeneous. Moreover, diffusion barriers may channel the migration of molecules in the ECS, so that diffusion is facilitated in a certain direction, i.e. diffusion in certain brain regions is anisotropic. Changes in the diffusion parameters have been found in many physiological and pathological states in which cell swelling, glial remodeling and extracellular matrix changes are key factors influencing diffusion. Changes in ECS volume, tortuosity and anisotropy significantly affect the accumulation and diffusion of neuroactive substances in the CNS and thus extrasynaptic transmission, neuron-glia communication, transmitter "spillover" and synaptic cross-talk as well as cell migration, drug delivery and treatment.},

	Abstract = {ATP-gated ionotropic P2X2 receptors are widely expressed in neurons. Although the electrophysiological properties of P2X2 receptors have been extensively studied, little is known about the plasma membrane lateral mobility of P2X2 receptors or whether receptor mobility is regulated by ATP. Here we used single-molecule imaging with simultaneous whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to track quantum dot-labeled P2X2 receptors in the dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons to explore P2X2 receptor mobility and its regulation. We find that plasma membrane P2X2 receptor lateral mobility in dendrites is heterogeneous but mostly Brownian in nature, consisting of mobile and slowly mobile receptor pools. Moreover, lateral mobility is P2X2 subunit and cell specific, is increased in an activation-dependent manner, and is regulated by cytosolic VILIP1, a calcium binding protein. Our data provide the first direct measures of P2X receptor mobility and show that P2X2 receptors are mobile ATP sensors, sampling more of the dendritic plasma membrane in response to ATP.},

	Abstract = {It has long been assumed that one important mechanism for the dissipation of local potassium gradients in the brain extracellular space is the so-called spatial buffer, generally associated with glial cells. To date, however, there has been no analytical description of the characteristic patterns of K ϩ clearance mediated by such a mechanism. This study reanalyzed a mathematical model of Gardner-Medwin (1983, J. Physiol. (Lond.). 335:393-- 426) that had previously been solved numer-ically. Under suitable approximations, the transient solutions for the potassium concentrations and the corresponding membrane potentials of glial cells in a finite, parallel domain were derived. The analytic results were substantiated by numerical simulations of a detailed two-compartment model. This simulation explored the dependence of spatial buffer current and extracellular K ϩ on the distribution of inward rectifier K ϩ channels in the glial endfoot and nonendfoot membranes, the glial geometric length, and the effect of passive KCl uptake. Regarding the glial cells as an equivalent leaky cable, the analyses indicated that a maximum endfoot current occurs when the glial geometric length is equal to the corresponding electrotonic space constant. Consequently, a long glial process is unsuitable for spatial buffering, unless the axial space constant can match the length of the process. Finally, this study discussed whether the spatial buffer mechanism is able to efficiently transport K ϩ over distances of more than several glial space constants.},

	Abstract = {1. Intracellular recordings in adult rat hippocampal slices were used to investigate the properties and origins of intrinsically generated bursts in the somata of CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs). The CA1 PCs were classified as either non-bursters or bursters according to the firing patterns evoked by intrasomatically applied long ( {\textgreater}or = 100 ms) depolarizing current pulses. Non-bursters generated stimulus-graded trains of independent action potentials, whereas bursters generated clusters of three or more closely spaced spikes riding on a distinct depolarizing envelope. 2. In all PCs fast spike repolarization was incomplete and ended at a potential approximately 10 mV more positive than resting potential. Solitary spikes were followed by a distinct after-depolarizing potential (ADP) lasting 20-40 ms. The ADP in most non-bursters declined monotonically to baseline ('passive' ADP), whereas in most bursters it remained steady or even re-depolarized before declining to baseline ('active' ADP). 3. Active, but not passive, ADPs were associated with an apparent increase in input conductance. They were maximal in amplitude when the spike was evoked from resting potential and were reduced by mild depolarization or hyperpolarization (+/- 2 mV). 4. Evoked and spontaneous burst firing was sensitive to small changes in membrane potential. In most cases maximal bursts were generated at resting potential and were curtailed by small depolarizations or hyperpolarizations (+/- 5 mV). 5. Bursts comprising clusters of spikelets ('d-spikes') were observed in 12{\%} of the bursters. Some of the d-spikes attained threshold for triggering full somatic spikes. Gradually hyperpolarizing these neurones blocked somatic spikes before blocking d-spikes, suggesting that the latter are generated at more remote sites. 6. The data suggest that active ADPs and intrinsic bursts in the somata of adult CA1 PCs are generated by a slow, voltage-gated inward current. Bursts arise in neurones in which this current is sufficiently large to generate suprathreshold ADPs, and thereby initiate a regenerative process of spike recruitment and slow depolarization.},

	Abstract = {Purinergic signaling plays important roles in control of vascular tone and remodeling. There is dual control of vascular tone by ATP released as a cotransmitter with noradrenaline from perivascular sympathetic nerves to cause vasoconstriction via P2X1 receptors, whereas ATP released from endothelial cells in response to changes in blood flow (producing shear stress) or hypoxia acts on P2X and P2Y receptors on endothelial cells to produce nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, which dilates vessels. ATP is also released from sensory-motor nerves during antidromic reflex activity to produce relaxation of some blood vessels. In this review, we stress the differences in neural and endothelial factors in purinergic control of different blood vessels. The long-term (trophic) actions of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides in promoting migration and proliferation of both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells via P1 and P2Y receptors during angiogenesis and vessel remodeling during restenosis after angioplasty are described. The pathophysiology of blood vessels and therapeutic potential of purinergic agents in diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia, thrombosis and stroke, diabetes, and migraine, is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Horizontal cells send inhibitory feedback to photoreceptors, helping form antagonistic receptive fields in the retina, but the neurotransmitter and the mechanisms underlying this signalling are not known. Since the proteins responsible for conventional Ca(2+)-dependent release of GABAergic synaptic vesicles are present in mammalian horizontal cells, we investigated this conventional mechanism as the means by which horizontal cells inhibit photoreceptors. Using Ca(2+) imaging in rat retinal slices, we confirm that horizontal cell depolarization with kainate inhibits and horizontal cell hyperpolarization with NBQX disinhibits the Ca(2+) signals produced by pH-sensitive activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca channels) in photoreceptors. We show that while 100 $\mu$m Co(2+) reduces photoreceptor Ca(2+) signals, it disinhibits them at 10 $\mu$m, an effect reminiscent of earlier studies where low [Co(2+)] eliminated feedback. The low [Co(2+)] disinhibition is pH sensitive. We localized L-, N- and P/Q-type Ca channels in rat horizontal cells, and showed that both the N-type Ca channel blocker -conotoxin GVIA and the P/Q-type Ca channel blocker -agatoxin IVA increased Ca(2+) signals in photoreceptors in a pH-sensitive manner. Pronounced actions of GABAergic agents on feedback signals to photoreceptors were observed, and are pH sensitive, but are inconsistent with direct inhibition by GABA of photoreceptor [Ca(2+)]. Patch-clamp studies revealed that GABA activates a conductance having high bicarbonate permeability in isolated horizontal cells, suggesting that the commonality of pH sensitivity throughout the results could arise from a GABA autofeedback action in horizontal cells. This could change cleft pH with concomitant inhibitory influences on photoreceptor Ca channels.},

	Abstract = {As high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and fMRI of cortical layers become more widely used, the question how well high-resolution fMRI signals reflect the underlying neural processing, and how to interpret laminar fMRI data becomes more and more relevant. High-resolution fMRI has shown laminar differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF), volume (CBV) and neurovascular coupling. Features and processes that were previously lumped into a single voxel become spatially distinct at high resolution. These features can be vascular compartments such as veins, arteries, and capillaries, or cortical layers and columns, which can have differences in metabolism. Mesoscopic models of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response therefore need to be expanded, for instance, to incorporate laminar differences in the coupling between neural activity, metabolism and the hemodynamic response. Here we discuss biological and methodological factors that affect the modeling and interpretation of high-resolution fMRI data. We also illustrate with examples from neuropharmacology and the negative BOLD response how combining BOLD with CBF- and CBV-based fMRI methods can provide additional information about neurovascular coupling, and can aid modeling and interpretation of high-resolution fMRI.},

With regard to spatial organization, signalling components are highly organized with respect to their cellular location and how they transmit information from one region of the cell to another. This spatial organization of signalling pathways depends on the molecular interactions that occur between signalling components that use signal transduction domains to construct signalling pathways. Very often, the components responsible for information transfer mechanisms are held in place by being attached to scaffolding proteins to form macromolecular signalling complexes. Sometimes these macromolecular complexes can be organized further by being localized to specific regions of the cell, as found in lipid rafts and caveolae or in the T-tubule regions of skeletal and cardiac cells},

	Abstract = {The oxygen exchange and correlation between the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in the cortical capillary levels for normal and pathologic brain functions remain the subject of debate. A 3D realistic mesoscale model of the cortical capillary network (non-tree like) is constructed using a random Voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. The hemodynamics and oxygen transport are numerically simulated in the model, which involves rheological laws in the capillaries, oxygen diffusion, and non-linear binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, respectively. The findings show that the cerebral hypoxia due to a significant decreased perfusion (as can occur in stroke) can be avoided by a moderate reduction in oxygen demand. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) can be an important indicator for the brain oxygen metabolism under normal perfusion and misery-perfusion syndrome (leading to ischemia). The results demonstrated that a disproportionately large increase in blood supply is required for a small increase in the oxygen demand, which, in turn, is strongly dependent on the resting OEF. The predicted flow-metabolism coupling in the model supports the experimental studies of spatiotemporal stimulations in humans by positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

@book{Fall2002,
	Abstract = {This textbook provides an introduction to dynamic modeling in cell biology, emphasizing computational approaches based on realistic molecular mechanisms. It is designed to introduce cell biology and neuroscience students to computational modeling, and applied mathematics students, theoretical biologists, and engineers to many of the problems in dynamical cell biology. This volume was conceived of and begun by Professor Joel Keizer based on his many years of teaching and research together with his colleagues. The project was expanded and finished by his students and friends after his untimely death in 1999. Carefully selected examples are used to motivate the concepts and techniques of computational cell biology, through a progression of increasingly more complex and demanding cases. Illustrative exercises are included with every chapter, and mathematical and computational appendices are provided for reference. This textbook will be useful for advanced undergraduate and graduate theoretical biologists, and for mathematics students and life scientists who wish to learn about modeling in cell biology. Royalties from this book will be donated to the Joel E. Keizer memorial endowment for collaborative interdisciplinary research in the life sciences.},

@article{Brisset2009,
	Abstract = {Cellular interaction in blood vessels is maintained by multiple communication pathways, including gap junctions. They consist of intercellular channels ensuring direct interaction between endothelial and smooth muscle cells and the synchronization of their behavior along the vascular wall. Gap-junction channels arise from the docking of two hemichannels or connexons, formed by the assembly of six connexins, and achieve direct cellular communication by allowing the transport of small metabolites, second messengers, and ions between two adjacent cells. Physiologic variations in connexin expression are observed along the vascular tree, with most common connexins being Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43. Changes in the level of expression of connexins have been correlated to the development of vascular disease, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, or restenosis. Recent studies on connexin-deficient mice highlighted key roles of these communication pathways in the development of these pathologies and confirmed the need for targeted pharmacologic approaches for their prevention and treatment. The aim of this issue is to review the current knowledge on the implication of gap junctions in vascular function and most common cardiovascular diseases.},

@article{Gordon2011,
	Abstract = {Astrocytes are the most numerous cells in the CNS. It is a defining feature of brain anatomy that every astrocyte has at least one contact with the vasculature, termed an endfoot. Collectively, all endfeet completely circumscribe all vessels in the brain. This unique anatomical feature has profound functional significance, as astrocyte endfeet have been discovered to release diffusible messengers that communicate directly with underlying smooth muscle cells to change arterial diameter and thereby regulate cerebral blood flow. A growing body of data now demonstrates that astrocytes serve as a bridge, relaying information on the level of neural activity to blood vessels in order to co-ordinate oxygen and glucose delivery with the energy demands of the tissue. In particular, astrocytes respond to elevations in extracellular glutamate as a consequence of synaptic transmission through the activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors. These Gq-coupled receptors elevate intracellular calcium via IP(3) signalling, which activates phospholipase A2 and generates arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid acts as a signalling molecule or is converted to several lipid derivates, including prostaglandin E(2) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Each of these lipids acts on vascular smooth muscle cells via different mechanisms to affect vessel diameter. Arachidonic acid initiates the production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid to cause vasoconstriction, whereas prostaglandin E(2) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids cause vasodilatation. Factors that determine whether constrictor or dilatory pathways predominate involve nitric oxide and brain metabolic elements, such as oxygen, lactate and adenosine. Thus, astrocytes are thought to be capable of bidirectional control of arterial diameter, and the type of influence depends on the state of brain activity.},

	Abstract = {A recent nonlinear system by Friston et al. (2000. NeuroImage 12: 466--477) links the changes in BOLD response to changes in neural activity. The system consists of five subsystems, linking: (1) neural activity to flow changes; (2) flow changes to oxygen delivery to tissue; (3) flow changes to changes in blood volume and venous outflow; (4) changes in flow, volume, and oxygen extraction fraction to deoxyhemoglobin changes; and finally (5) volume and deoxyhemoglobin changes to the BOLD response. Friston et al. exploit, in subsystem 2, a model by Buxton and Frank coupling flow changes to changes in oxygen metabolism which assumes tissue oxygen concentration to be close to zero. We describe below a model of the coupling between flow and oxygen delivery which takes into account the modulatory effect of changes in tissue oxygen concentration. The major development has been to extend the original Buxton and Frank model for oxygen transport to a full dynamic capillary model making the model applicable to both transient and steady state conditions. Furthermore our modification enables us to determine the time series of CMRO2 changes under different conditions, including CO2 challenges. We compare the differences in the performance of the ``Friston system'' using the original model of Buxton and Frank and that of our model. We also compare the data predicted by our model (with appropriate parameters) to data from a series of OIS studies. The qualitative differences in the behaviour of the models are exposed by different experimental simulations and by comparison with the results of OIS data from brief and extended stimulation protocols and from experiments using hypercapnia.},

This CBF response, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry, was attenuated by the muscarinic type acetylcholine receptor antagonist atropine, suggesting a possible involvement of astrocytes in this type of CBF modulation. However, we find that IP3R2 knockout mice, which lack cytosolic Ca2+ surges in astrocytes, show similar CBF changes. Moreover, whisker stimulation resulted in similar degrees of CBF increase in IP3R2 knockout mice and the background strain C57BL/6J. Our results show that neural activity-driven CBF modulation could occur without large cytosolic increases of Ca2+ in astrocytes.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the haemodynamic responses to brief ({\textless}2 secs) stimuli can be well characterised as a linear convolution of neural activity with a suitable haemodynamic impulse response. In this paper, we show that the linear convolution model cannot predict measurements of blood flow responses to stimuli of longer duration ({\textgreater}2 secs), regardless of the impulse response function chosen. Modifying the linear convolution scheme to a nonlinear convolution scheme was found to provide a good prediction of the observed data. Whereas several studies have found a nonlinear coupling between stimulus input and blood flow responses, the current modelling scheme uses neural activity as an input, and thus implies nonlinearity in the coupling between neural activity and blood flow responses. Neural activity was assessed by current source density analysis of depth-resolved evoked field potentials, while blood flow responses were measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. All measurements were made in rat whisker barrel cortex after electrical stimulation of the whisker pad for 1 to 16 secs at 5 Hz and 1.2 mA (individual pulse width 0.3 ms).},

There are four classes of glial cells in the brain that differ by their origin, morphology, and function: microglia, oligodendrocytes, NG2 (nerve/glia antigen 2) cells, and astrocytes. Microglial cells, which are derived from the mesoderm, represent approximately 10{\%} of glia and are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Three subclasses compose the macroglia and are derived from the ectoderm. As an overview one can consider that: (1) the oligodendrocytes are mainly involved in the myelination of axons, (2) the NG2 cells comprise oligodendrocyte precursor cells but they are also multipotential cells, although this issue is still debated, and (3) finally, astrocytes are the predominant glial cells in the brain that establish active interactionswith neurons and the vascular system. With the exception of NG2 cells, all glial cells are characterized by the expression of gap junction proteins (connexins)with specific features and properties. In addition, a number of neuropathological disorders involve changes in Cx expression and channel function.},

@article{Karch2000,
	Abstract = {There is a marked difference in the structure of the arterial tree between epi- and endocardial layers of the human heart. To model these structural variations, we developed an extension to the computational method of constrained constructive optimization (CCO). Within the framework of CCO, a model tree is represented as a dichotomously branching network of straight cylindrical tubes, with flow conditions governed by Poiseuille's law. The tree is grown by successively adding new terminal segments from randomly selected points within the perfusion volume while optimizing the geometric location and topological site of each new connection with respect to minimum intravascular volume. The proposed method of "staged growth" guides the generation of new terminal sites by means of an additional time-dependent boundary condition, thereby inducing a sequence of domains of vascular growth within the given perfusion volume. Model trees generated in this way are very similar to reality in their visual appearance and predict diameter ratios of parent and daughter segments, the distribution of symmetry, the transmural distribution of flow, the volume of large arteries, as well as the ratio of small arterial volume in subendocardial and subepicardial layers in good agreement with experimental data. From this study we conclude that the method of CCO combined with staged growth reproduces many characteristics of the different arterial branching patterns in the subendocardium and the subepicardium, which could not be obtained by applying the principle of minimum volume alone.},

We first show that the equations for the coupled oscillators admit an invariant {\$}(n + 1){\$}-torus on which the equations have a special form, one in which an n-dimensional subsystem is approximately invariant. We then show that when the linear gradient becomes too steep to allow phaselocking, there emerges a large-scale invariant circle in this n-dimensional system which corresponds to the existence of a pair of plateaus, and whose homotopy class within the n-torus corresponds to the position of the frequency jump. Also discussed are the effects of anisotropic and nonuniform coupling.},

	Abstract = {Rett syndrome is a severe pediatric neurological disorder caused by loss of function mutations within the gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although MeCP2 is expressed near ubiquitously, the primary pathophysiology of Rett syndrome stems from impairments of nervous system function. One alteration within different regions of the MeCP2-deficient brain is the presence of hyper-excitable network responses. In the hippocampus, such responses exist despite there being an overall decrease in spontaneous excitatory drive within the network. In this study, we generated and used mathematical, neuronal network models to resolve this apparent paradox. We did this by taking advantage of previous mathematical modelling insights that indicated that decreased excitatory fluctuations, but not mean excitatory drive, more critically explain observed changes in hippocampal network oscillations from MeCP2-null mouse slices. Importantly, reduced excitatory fluctuations could also bring about hyper-excitable responses in our network models. Therefore, these results indicate that diminished excitatory fluctuations may be responsible for the hyper-excitable state of MeCP2-deficient hippocampal circuitry.},

	Abstract = {Integration and coordination of responses among vascular wall cells are critical to the local modulation of vasomotor tone and to the maintenance of circulatory homeostasis. This article reviews the vast literature concerning the principles that govern the initiation and propagation of vasoactive stimuli among vascular smooth muscle cells, which are nominally the final effectors of vasomotor tone. In light of the abundance of new information concerning the distribution and function of gap junctions between vascular wall cells throughout the vascular tree, particular attention is paid to this integral aspect of vascular physiology. Evidence is provided for the important contribution of intercellular communication to vascular function at all levels of the circulation, from the largest elastic artery to the terminal arterioles. The thesis of this review is that the presence of gap junctions, in concert with the autonomic nervous system, pacemaker cells, myogenic mechanisms, and/or electrotonic current spread (both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing waves through gap junctions), confers a plasticity, adaptability, and flexibility to vasculature that may well account for the observed diversity in regulation and function of vascular tissues throughout the vascular tree. It is hoped that the summary information provided here will serve as a launching pad for a new discourse on the mechanistic basis of the integrative regulation and function of vasculature, which painstakingly accounts for the undoubtedly complex and manifold role of gap junctions in vascular physiology/dysfunction.},

	Abstract = {It is has been suggested that decreased production of the vasodilatory and anti-aggregative substance NO (nitric oxide) may result in lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) in injured areas of the traumatized brain. The NO-precursor l-arginine has been shown to counteract CBF decreases early after trauma, but microcirculatory and more long-term effects on CBF of l-arginine have not been investigated. In an attempt to analyze effects of l-arginine on the microcirculation in the traumatized brain, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of l-arginine compared to vehicle (0.9{\%} saline) following a standardized controlled cortical-impact brain trauma in mice. Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [14C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant Ki for [51Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex. Cortical blood flow in the injured cortex was 0.43 ?? 0.3??mL/g/min and 0.81 ?? 0.3??mL/g/min 3??h after trauma in the vehicle and l-arginine groups, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), and no treatment effect was seen 24??h after trauma. The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by l-arginine. Ki increased following trauma and was unaffected by l-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the l-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3??h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24??h after trauma. We conclude that l-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is impaired following stroke. However, the relationship between dCA, brain atrophy, and functional outcomes following stroke remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine whether impairment of dCA is associated with atrophy in specific regions or globally, thereby affecting daily functions in stroke patients.We performed a retrospective analysis of 33 subjects with chronic infarctions in the middle cerebral artery territory, and 109 age-matched non-stroke subjects. dCA was assessed via the phase relationship between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity. Brain tissue volumes were quantified from MRI. Functional status was assessed by gait speed, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), modified Rankin Scale, and NIH Stroke Score.Compared to the non-stroke group, stroke subjects showed degraded dCA bilaterally, and showed gray matter atrophy in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes ipsilateral to infarct. In stroke subjects, better dCA was associated with less temporal lobe gray matter atrophy on the infracted side ([Formula: see text] = 0.029), faster gait speed ([Formula: see text] = 0.018) and lower IADL score ([Formula: see text]0.002). Our results indicate that better dynamic cerebral perfusion regulation is associated with less atrophy and better long-term functional status in older adults with chronic ischemic infarctions.},

	Abstract = {Calcium puffs describe the transient release of Ca(2+) ions into the cytosol, through small clusters of 1,4,5-inositol triphosphate (IP(3)) receptors, present on internal stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum. Statistical properties of puffs, such as puff amplitudes and durations, have been well characterized experimentally. We model calcium puffs using a simple, sequential-binding model for the IP(3) receptor in conjunction with a computationally inexpensive point-source approximation. We follow two different protocols, a sequential protocol and a renewal protocol. In the sequential protocol, puffs are generated successively by the same cluster; in the renewal protocol, the system is reset after each puff. In both cases for a single set of parameters our results are in excellent agreement with experimental results for puff amplitudes and durations but indicate puff-to-puff correlations for the sequential protocol, consistent with recent experimental findings [H. J. Rose, S. Dargan, J. W. Shuai, and I. Parker, Biophys. J. 91, 4024 (2006)]. The model is then used to test the consistency of the hypothesized steep Ca(2+) gradients around single channels with the experimentally observed features of puff durations and amplitudes. A three-dimensional implementation of our point-source model suggests that a peak Ca(2+) concentration of the order of 10 muM at the cluster site (not channel) is consistent with the statistical features of observed calcium puffs.},

	Abstract = {Background Experimental evidence suggests that flow-dependent dilatation of conduit arteries is mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and/or prostacyclin. The present study was designed to assess whether NO or prostacyclin also contributes to flow-dependent dilatation of conduit arteries in humans. Methods and Results Radial artery internal diameter (ID) was measured continuously in 16 healthy volunteers (age, 24{\{}+/-{\}}1 years) with a transcutaneous A-mode echo-tracking system coupled to a Doppler device for the measurement of radial blood flow. In 8 subjects, a catheter was inserted into the brachial artery for measurement of arterial pressure and infusion of the NO synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 8 {\{}micro{\}}mol/min for 7 minutes; infusion rate, 0.8 mL/min). Flow-dependent dilatation was evaluated before and after L-NMMA or aspirin as the response of the radial artery to an acute increase in flow (reactive hyperemia after a 3-minute cuff wrist occlusion). Under control conditions, release of the occlusion induced a marked increase in radial blood flow (from 24{\{}+/-{\}}3 to 73{\{}+/-{\}}11 mL/min; P{\textless}.01) followed by a delayed increase in radial diameter (flow-mediated dilatation; from 2.67{\{}+/-{\}}0.10 to 2.77{\{}+/-{\}}0.12 mm; P{\textless}.01) without any change in heart rate or arterial pressure. L-NMMA decreased basal forearm blood flow (from 24{\{}+/-{\}}3 to 13{\{}+/-{\}}3 mL/min; P{\textless}.05) without affecting basal radial artery diameter, heart rate, or arterial pressure, whereas aspirin (1 g PO) was without any hemodynamic effect. In the presence of L-NMMA, the peak flow response during hyperemia was not affected (76{\{}+/-{\}}12 mL/min), but the duration of the hyperemic response was markedly reduced, and the flow-dependent dilatation of the radial artery was abolished and converted to a vasoconstriction (from 2.62{\{}+/-{\}}0.11 to 2.55{\{}+/-{\}}0.11 mm; P{\textless}.01). In contrast, aspirin did not affect the hyperemic response nor the flow-dependent dilatation of the radial artery. Conclusions The present investigation demonstrates that NO, but not prostacyclin, is essential for flow-mediated dilatation of large human arteries. Hence, this response can be used as a test for the L-arginine/NO pathway in clinical studies.},

	Abstract = {Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is the predominant enzyme responsible for vascular NO synthesis. A functional eNOS transfers electrons from NADPH to its heme center, where L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO. Common conditions predisposing to atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking, are associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced amounts of bioactive NO in the vessel wall. NADPH oxidases represent major sources of ROS in cardiovascular pathophysiology. NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide avidly interacts with eNOS-derived NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), which oxidizes the essential NOS cofactor (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). As a consequence, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby rendering NOS to a superoxide-producing pro-atherosclerotic enzyme. Supplementation with BH(4) corrects eNOS dysfunction in several animal models and in patients. Administration of high local doses of the antioxidant L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) improves endothelial function, whereas large-scale clinical trials do not support a strong role for oral vitamin C and/or E in reducing cardiovascular disease. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers have the potential of reducing vascular oxidative stress. Finally, novel approaches are being tested to block pathways leading to oxidative stress (e.g. protein kinase C) or to upregulate antioxidant enzymes.},

Here, we present a unified mean-field theory for capacitive charging and desalination by ideally polarizable porous electrodes (without Faradaic reactions or specific adsorption of ions) valid in the limit of thin double layers (compared to typical pore dimensions). We illustrate the theory for the case of a dilute, symmetric, binary electrolyte using the Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) model of the double layer, for which simple formulae are available for salt adsorption and capacitive charging of the diffuse part of the double layer. We solve the full GCS mean-field theory numerically for realistic parameters in capacitive deionization, and we derive reduced models for two limiting regimes with different time scales: (i) in the "supercapacitor regime" of small voltages and/or early times, the porous electrode acts like a transmission line, governed by a linear diffusion equation for the electrostatic potential, scaled to the RC time of a single pore, and (ii) in the "desalination regime" of large voltages and long times, the porous electrode slowly absorbs counterions, governed by coupled, nonlinear diffusion equations for the pore-averaged potential and salt concentration.},

We used high-throughput histology to reconstruct the complete angioarchitecture and the positions of all neuronal somata of multiple cubic millimeter regions of vibrissa primary sensory cortex in mouse. Vascular networks were derived from the reconstruction. In contrast with the standard model of cortical columns that are tightly linked with the vascular network, graph-theoretical analyses revealed that the subsurface microvasculature formed interconnected loops with a topology that was invariant to the position and boundary of columns. Furthermore, the calculated patterns of blood flow in the networks were unrelated to location of columns. Rather, blood sourced by penetrating arterioles was effectively drained by the penetrating venules to limit lateral perfusion. This analysis provides the underpinning to understand functional imaging and the effect of penetrating vessels strokes on brain viability.},

Nitric oxide mediates a plethora of physiological functions, for example, maintenance of vascular tone and inflammation. Apart from these physiological functions, NO is also involved in the pathophysiology of various disorders, specifically those in which regulation of blood flow and inflammation has a key role. The aim of the current review is to summarize the role of NO in cerebral ischemia, the most common cause of stroke.},

However, recent work has suggested that most brain energy is used to power postsynaptic currents and action potentials rather than presynaptic or glial activity and, furthermore, that haemodynamic responses are driven by neurotransmitter-related signalling and not directly by the local energy needs of the brain. A firm understanding of the BOLD response will require investigation to be focussed on the neural signalling mechanisms controlling blood flow rather than on the locus of energy use.},

	Abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

The present study investigated the effects of a single bilateral i.c.v. infusion of pre-aggregated A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35) (30 nmol/rat) on animals' performance in the open field, and on arginine metabolic enzymes and metabolites in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the time point of 6-8 days after A{\$}\beta{\$} infusion. A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35) rats displayed reduced exploratory activity in the open field relative to the A{\$}\beta{\$}(35-25) (reverse peptide; 30 nmol) rats. A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35) resulted in significantly decreased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS protein expression, but increased arginase activity, arginase II protein expression, and ornithine and putrescine levels, in hippocampal CA2/3. There were increased glutamate and putrescine levels in the DG, but decreased agmatine levels in the DG and PFC, in the A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35) group relative to the A{\$}\beta{\$}(35-25) one. Cluster analyses were performed to determine if the nine related neurochemical variables (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spemine, glutamate, and GABA) formed distinct groups, and whether it changed as a function of A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35). There were substantially different clusters between the two groups in the hippocampus and PFC. These results demonstrate that A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35) alters arginine metabolism, which further supports the prominent role of arginine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.},

@article{Wang2008,
	Abstract = {Airway hyperresponsiveness is a major characteristic of asthma and is believed to result from the excessive contraction of airway smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the identification of the mechanisms responsible for airway hyperresponsiveness is hindered by our limited understanding of how calcium (Ca2+), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) interact to regulate airway SMC contraction. In this work, we present a modified Hai-Murphy cross-bridge model of SMC contraction that incorporates Ca2+ regulation of MLCK and MLCP. A comparative fit of the model simulations to experimental data predicts 1), that airway and arteriole SMC contraction is initiated by fast activation by Ca2+ of MLCK; 2), that airway SMC, but not arteriole SMC, is inhibited by a slower activation by Ca2+ of MLCP; and 3), that the presence of a contractile agonist inhibits MLCP to enhance the Ca2+ sensitivity of airway and arteriole SMCs. The implication of these findings is that murine airway SMCs exploit a Ca2+-dependent mechanism to favor a default state of relaxation. The rate of SMC relaxation is determined principally by the rate of release of the latch-bridge state, which is predicted to be faster in airway than in arteriole. In addition, the model also predicts that oscillations in calcium concentration, commonly observed during agonist-induced smooth muscle contraction, cause a significantly greater contraction than an elevated steady calcium concentration.},

@article{Kourembanas1993,
	Abstract = {The mechanisms by which hypoxia causes vasoconstriction in vivo are not known. Accumulating evidence implicates the endothelium as a key regulator of vascular tone. Hypoxia induces the expression and secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor in cultured human endothelial cells. We report here that nitric oxide (NO), an endothelial-derived relaxing factor, modifies this induction of ET-1. Whereas low oxygen tension (PO2 = 20-30 Torr) increases ET-1 expression four- to eightfold above that seen at normal oxygen tension (PO2 = 150 Torr), sodium nitroprusside, which releases NO, suppresses this effect. This inhibition of hypoxia-induced ET-1 expression occurs within the first hour of exposure of cells to sodium nitroprusside. Moreover, when the endogenous constitutive levels of NO made by endothelial cells are suppressed using N-omega-nitro-L-arginine, a potent competitive inhibitor of NO synthase, the baseline levels of ET-1 produced in normoxic environments are increased three- to fourfold. The effects of hypoxia and the NO synthase inhibitor on ET-1 expression are additive. The regulation of ET-1 production by NO appears to be at the level of transcription. Similar effects of NO were observed on the expression of the PDGF-B chain gene. PDGF-B expression was suppressed by NO in a hypoxic environment and induced by N-omega-nitro-L-arginine in both normoxic and hypoxic environments. These findings suggest that in addition to its role as a vasodilator, NO may also influence vascular tone via the regulated reciprocal production of ET-1 and PDGF-B in the vasculature.},

@article{Offenhauser2005,
	Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging relies on the robust coupling between neuronal activity, metabolism and cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the physiological basis of the neuroimaging signals is still poorly understood. We examined the mechanisms of activity-dependent changes in tissue oxygenation in relation to variations in CBF responses and postsynaptic activity in rat cerebellar cortex. To increase synaptic activity we stimulated the monosynaptic, glutamatergic climbing fibres that excite Purkinje cells via AMPA receptors. We used local field potentials to indicate synaptic activity, and recorded tissue oxygen partial pressure (P(tiss,O2)) by polarographic microelectrodes, and CBF using laser-Doppler flowmetry. The disappearance rate of oxygen in the tissue increased linearly with synaptic activity. This indicated that, without a threshold, oxygen consumption increased as a linear function of synaptic activity. The reduction in P(tiss,O2) preceded the rise in CBF. The time integral (area) of the negative P(tiss,O2) response increased non-linearly showing saturation at high levels of synaptic activity, concomitant with a steep rise in CBF. This was accompanied by a positive change in P(tiss,O2). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition enhanced the initial negative P(tiss,O2) response ('dip'), while attenuating the evoked CBF increase and positive P(tiss,O2) response equally. This indicates that increases in CBF counteract activity-induced reductions in P(tiss,O2), and suggests the presence of a tissue oxygen reserve. The changes in P(tiss,O2) and CBF were strongly attenuated by AMPA receptor blockade. Our findings suggest an inverse relationship between negative P(tiss,O2) and CBF responses, and provide direct in vivo evidence for a tight coupling between activity in postsynaptic AMPA receptors and cerebellar oxygen consumption.},

	Abstract = {Intercellular calcium waves have been observed in a large number of cell types, and are known to result from a variety of stimuli, including mechanical or hormonal stimulation. Recently, spiral intercellular waves of calcium have been observed in slices of hippocampal tissue. We use an existing model to study the properties of spiral intercellular calcium waves. Although intercellular spiral waves are well known in the context of cardiac muscle, due to the small value of the calcium diffusion coefficient intercellular calcium waves have fundamentally different properties. We show that homogenisation techniques give a good estimate for the plane wave speed, but do not describe spiral behaviour well. Using an expression for the effective diffusion coefficient we estimate the intercellular calcium permeability in liver. For the bistable equation, we derive an analytic estimate for the value of the intercellular permeability at which wave propagation fails. In the calcium wave model, we show numerically that the spiral period is first a decreasing, then an increasing, function of the intercellular permeability. We hypothesise that this is because the curvature of the spiral core is unimportant at low permeability, the period being approximately set instead by the speed of a plane wave along a line of coupled cells in one dimension.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel rational macromodeling approach for the description of 1D blood flow in the human cardiovascular system, which is suitable for time-domain simulations. Using the analogy of the blood flow propagation problem with transmission lines and considering the hypothesis of linearized Navier-Stokes equations, a frequency-domain rational macromodel for each arterial segment has been built. The poles and the residues of each arterial segment macromodel have been calculated by means of the Vector Fitting technique. Finally, the rational macromodel of the whole cardiovascular system is obtained by properly combining the macromodels of the single arterial segments using an interconnect matrix. The rational form of the proposed cardiovascular model leads to a state-space or electrical circuit model suitable for time-domain analysis. The stability and passivity properties of the global cardiovascular model are discussed to guarantee stable time-domain simulations. The proposed macromodeling approach has been validated by pertinent numerical results. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {These studies were designed to determine the role of cerebral vascular endothelium in the "myogenic" depolarization and contraction observed in isolated cat middle cerebral arteries exposed to high transmural pressures. With intact endothelial cells we observed, on elevation of transmural pressure in cannulated isolated arteries, significant membrane depolarization, action potential generation, and reduction in internal diameter. After perfusion of the same vessels with collagenase and elastase for short periods of time to disrupt the endothelial layer, all previous responses to elevation of transmural pressure were no longer seen. Even though enzyme perfusion had no effect on membrane potential at "control" levels of transmural pressure, it abolished the pressure-dependent depolarization, action potential generation, and constriction. Furthermore, the contractile response to agonist stimulation was maintained after endothelial disruption via enzymes, showing that this method of endothelial disruption did not appreciably damage muscle cells. The data document a dependence of an intact endothelium in mediating the activation of isolated cat cerebral arteries in response to a changing transmural pressure. Thus, it is possible that the endothelial cell may serve as a transducer in the autoregulatory response to pressure.},

	Abstract = {The G-protein-coupled lactate receptor, GPR81 (HCA1), is known to promote lipid storage in adipocytes by downregulating cAMP levels. Here, we show that GPR81 is also present in the mammalian brain, including regions of the cerebral neocortex and hippocampus, where it can be activated by physiological concentrations of lactate and by the specific GPR81 agonist 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate to reduce cAMP. Cerebral GPR81 is concentrated on the synaptic membranes of excitatory synapses, with a postsynaptic predominance. GPR81 is also enriched at the blood-brain-barrier: the GPR81 densities at endothelial cell membranes are about twice the GPR81 density at membranes of perivascular astrocytic processes, but about one-seventh of that on synaptic membranes. There is only a slight signal in perisynaptic processes of astrocytes. In synaptic spines, as well as in adipocytes, GPR81 immunoreactivity is located on subplasmalemmal vesicular organelles, suggesting trafficking of the protein to and from the plasma membrane. The results indicate roles of lactate in brain signaling, including a neuronal glucose and glycogen saving response to the supply of lactate. We propose that lactate, through activation of GPR81 receptors, can act as a volume transmitter that links neuronal activity, cerebral energy metabolism and energy substrate availability.},

	Abstract = {Because regional blood flow increases in association with the increased metabolic demand generated by localized increases in neural activity, functional imaging researchers often assume that changes in blood flow are an accurate read-out of changes in underlying neural activity. An understanding of the mechanisms that link changes in neural activity to changes in blood flow is crucial for assessing the validity of this assumption, and for understanding the processes that can go wrong during disease states such as ischaemic stroke. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms of neurovascular regulation in arterioles but other evidence suggests that blood flow regulation can also occur in capillaries, because of the presence of contractile cells, pericytes, on the capillary wall. Here we review the evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary diameter in response to neuronal activity and assess the likely importance of neurovascular regulation at the capillary level for functional imaging experiments. We also discuss evidence suggesting that pericytes are particularly sensitive to damage during pathological insults such as ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease and diabetic retinopathy, and consider the potential impact that pericyte dysfunction might have on the development of therapeutic interventions and on the interpretation of functional imaging data in these disorders.},

	Abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction is controlled by the Ca2+ and
Rho kinase signalling pathways. While the SMC Rho kinase system seems
to be reasonably constant, there is enormous variation with regard
to the mechanisms responsible for generating Ca2+ signals. One way
of dealing with this diversity is to consider how this system has
been adapted to control different SMC functions. Phasic SMCs (vas
deferens, uterus and bladder) rely on membrane depolarization to
drive Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This depolarization
can be induced by neurotransmitters or through the operation of a
membrane oscillator. Many tonic SMCs (vascular, airway and corpus
cavernosum) are driven by a cytosolic Ca2+ oscillator that generates
periodic pulses of Ca2+. A similar oscillator is present in pacemaker
cells such as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and atypical
SMCs that control other tonic SMCs (gastrointestinal, urethra, ureter).
The changes in membrane potential induced by these cytosolic oscillators
does not drive contraction directly but it functions to couple together
individual oscillators to provide the synchronization that is a characteristic
feature of many tonic SMCs.},

	Abstract = {We developed a mathematical model to investigate the production and transport of nitric oxide (NO) generated by a monolayer of cultured endothelial cells exposed to flow in a parallel plate flow chamber. The objectives were to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental observations and to suggest a quantitative relationship between shear stress and NO production rate. NO production was described as a combination of a basal production rate term and a shear-dependent term. Our results show that the shear stress-dependence of the production of NO by the endothelium influences the nature of mass transport within the boundary layer. We found that the steady state NO concentration near the endothelial surface exhibits a biphasic dependence on shear stress, in which at low flow, NO concentration decreases owing to the enhanced removal by convective transport while only at higher shear stresses does the increased production cause an increase in NO concentration. The unsteady response to step changes in flow exhibits transient fluctuations in NO that can be explained by time-dependent changes in the diffusive and convective mass transport as the concentration profile evolves. Our results indicate that this model can be used to determine the relationship between shear stress and NO production rate from measurements of NO concentration.},

	Abstract = {ATP is an extracellular signaling molecule that activates specific G protein-coupled P2Y receptors in most cell types to mediate diverse biological effects. ATP has been shown to activate the phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in various systems. However, little is known about the signaling events in human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs). The objective of this study was to examine the presence of the P2Y2 receptor and the effects of exogenous ATP on the intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway, immediate early genes expression, and cell viability in hESCs. Western blot analysis, gene array analysis, and MTT assay for cell viability were performed. The current study demonstrated the existence of the P2Y2 purinergic receptor in hESCs. UTP and ATP activated MAPK in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Suramin (a P2-purinoceptor antagonist), neomycin (a PLC inhibitor), staurosporin (a PKC inhibitor), and PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) significantly attenuated the ATP-induced activation of MAPK. ATP activated ERK1/2 and induced translocation of activated ERK1/2 to the nucleus. The gene array for 23 genes associated with members of the mitogenic pathway cascade and immediate early genes revealed that the expression of early growth response 1 was increased. In addition, MTT assay revealed an inhibition effect of ATP on cell viability. ATP activated MAPKs through the P2Y2 purinoceptor/PLC/PKC/ERK signaling pathway and induced translocation of ERK1/2 into the nucleus. Further, ATP induced the expression of early growth response 1 and inhibited cell viability in hESCs. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The level of [InsP3]cyt required for calcium release in A7r5 cells, a smooth muscle cell line, was determined by a new set of procedures using quantitative confocal microscopy to measure release of InsP3 from cells microinjected with caged InsP3. From these experiments, the [InsP3]cyt required to evoke a half-maximal calcium response is 100 nM. Experiments with caged glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (GPIP2), a slowly metabolized analogue of InsP3, gave a much slower recovery and a half-maximal response of an order of magnitude greater than InsP3. Experimental data and highly constrained variables were used to construct a mathematical model of the InsP3-dependent [Ca2+]cyt changes; the resulting simulations show high fidelity to experiment. Among the elements considered in constructing this model were the mechanism of the InsP3-receptor, InsP3 degradation, calcium buffering in the cytosol, and refilling of the ER stores via sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The model predicts a time constant of 0.8 s for InsP3 degradation and 13 s for GPIP2. InsP3 degradation was found to be a prerequisite for [Ca2+]cyt recovery to baseline levels and is therefore critical to the pattern of the overall [Ca2+]cyt signal. Analysis of the features of this model provides insights into the individual factors controlling the amplitude and shape of the InsP3-mediated calcium signal.},

	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: Vasodilatory prostaglandins play a key role in neurovascular coupling (NVC), the tight link between neuronal activity and local cerebral blood flow, but their precise identity, cellular origin and the receptors involved remain unclear. Here we show in rats that NMDA-induced vasodilation and hemodynamic responses evoked by whisker stimulation involve cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity and activation of the prostaglandin E2 (PgE2) receptors EP2 and EP4. Using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that PgE2 is released by NMDA in cortical slices. The characterization of PgE2 producing cells by immunohistochemistry and single-cell reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that pyramidal cells and not astrocytes are the main cell type equipped for PgE2 synthesis, one third expressing COX-2 systematically associated with a PgE2 synthase. Consistent with their central role in NVC, in vivo optogenetic stimulation of pyramidal cells evoked COX-2-dependent hyperemic responses in mice. These observations identify PgE2 as the main prostaglandin mediating sensory-evoked NVC, pyramidal cells as their principal source and vasodilatory EP2 and EP4 receptors as their targets.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Brain function critically depends on a permanent spatiotemporal match between neuronal activity and blood supply, known as NVC. In the cerebral cortex, prostaglandins are major contributors to NVC. However, their biochemical identity remains elusive and their cellular origins are still under debate. Although astrocytes can induce vasodilations through the release of prostaglandins, the recruitment of this pathway during sensory stimulation is questioned. Using multidisciplinary approaches from single-cell reverse transcriptase-PCR, mass spectrometry, to ex vivo and in vivo pharmacology and optogenetics, we provide compelling evidence identifying PgE2 as the main prostaglandin in NVC, pyramidal neurons as their main cellular source and the vasodilatory EP2 and EP4 receptors as their main targets. These original findings will certainly change the current view of NVC.},

	Abstract = {A general mathematical model for the delivery of O2 to the brain is presented, based on the assumptions that all of the brain capillaries are perfused at rest and that all of the oxygen extracted from the capillaries is metabolized. The model predicts that disproportionately large changes in blood flow are required in order to support small changes in the O2 metabolic rate. Interpreted in terms of this model, previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the human brain during neural stimulation demonstrating that cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases much more than the oxygen metabolic rate are consistent with tight coupling of flow and oxidative metabolism. The model provides a basis for the quantitative interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in terms of changes in local CBF.},

	Abstract = {The tight spatial and temporal coupling between neuronal activity and blood flow ensures that active brain regions receive an adequate supply of oxygen and energetic metabolites. There clearly is still an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work to be done to unravel the precise mechanism of neurovascular coupling, but over the last decade significant advances have been made. The most recent studies confirm the original finding that the activation of Ca2+ elevations in astrocyte endfeet is an essential step but also reveal new levels of complexity in the astrocyte control of neurovascular coupling. The recent evidence for a link between Ca2+ signalling in astrocytes and local metabolic states of the brain tissue has broad implications for the interpretation of data from functional brain imaging studies. Unraveling the full molecular mechanism of the astrocyte control of cerebral blood flow represents a formidable challenge in neurobiological research in the years to come that might also create opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke, hypertension and migraine as well as neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {The cerebral hemodynamics through the Circle of Willis (CoW) was modeled by coupling a three-dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the CoW with a one-dimensional (1D) branching tree model of the peripheral cerebral vasculature. CFD was used to model the 3D transient flow through idealized and patient-specific CoW geometries. A 1D pipe network model was also used to predict the flow through the idealized CoW. The coupled model provided useful insight into the variation of the flow through the CoW as a result of possible physiological and pathological changes (for example associated with 'onset' of Alzheimer's Disease) in the peripheral networks of small cerebral vasculature. A comparison was made between the complete CoW and geometric variations with communicating arteries missing. A CoW inflow ratio showed that vasoconstriction of the peripheral vasculature of the posterior cerebral artery predominantly decreases the flow rate in the vertebral arteries, while vasoconstriction of the peripheral vasculature of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries predominantly decreases the flow rate of the internal carotid arteries. These changes in inflow in arteries that are easily monitored may be used to determine if there is vasoconstriction of the peripheral small cerebral vasculature which may indicate diseased states.},

	Abstract = {Glucose is the main energy substrate in the adult brain under normal conditions. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that lactate produced in astrocytes (a type of glial cell) can also fuel neuronal activity. The quantitative aspects of this so-called astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) are still debated. To address this question, we developed a detailed biophysical model of the brain's metabolic interactions. Our model integrates three modeling approaches, the Buxton-Wang model of vascular dynamics, the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of neuronal membrane excitability and a biophysical model of metabolic pathways. This approach provides a template for large-scale simulations of the neuron-glia-vasculature (NGV) ensemble, and for the first time integrates the respective timescales at which energy metabolism and neuronal excitability occur. The model is constrained by relative neuronal and astrocytic oxygen and glucose utilization, by the concentration of metabolites at rest and by the temporal dynamics of NADH upon activation. These constraints produced four observations. First, a transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons emerged in response to activity. Second, constrained by activity-dependent NADH transients, neuronal oxidative metabolism increased first upon activation with a subsequent delayed astrocytic glycolysis increase. Third, the model correctly predicted the dynamics of extracellular lactate and oxygen as observed in vivo in rats. Fourth, the model correctly predicted the temporal dynamics of tissue lactate, of tissue glucose and oxygen consumption, and of the BOLD signal as reported in human studies. These findings not only support the ANLS hypothesis but also provide a quantitative mathematical description of the metabolic activation in neurons and glial cells, as well as of the macroscopic measurements obtained during brain imaging.},

It is observed clinically through related flow variations (flux motion) which are detected by laser Doppler flowmetry. It presents two distinct regimens: slow and fast waves, with frequencies of 1-2 and 10-20 cpm, respectively. Both activities are found in normal tissues, and their rate of incidence as well as their magnitude become significantly enhanced during abnormal conditions associated with low blood pressure and hypoperfusion. The institution of this activity by abnormal tissue conditions suggests that vasomotion is a reaction of the microcirculation aimed at improving microvascular function.},

	Abstract = {Endothelial cells release nitric oxide (NO) more potently in response to increased shear stress than to agonists which elevate intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). To determine mechanistic differences in the regulation of endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), we measured NO production by bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber or treated with Ca2+ ionophores in static culture. The kinetics of cumulative NO production varied strikingly: shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) stimulated a biphasic increase over control that was 13-fold at 60 minutes, whereas raising [Ca2+]i caused a monophasic 6-fold increase. We hypothesized that activation of a protein kinase cascade mediates the early phase of flow-dependent NO production. Immunoprecipitation of ecNOS showed a 210{\%} increase in phosphorylation 1 minute after flow initiation, whereas there was no significant increase after Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Although ecNOS was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the early phase of flow-dependent NO production was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. To determine the Ca2+ requirement for flow-dependent NO production, we measured [Ca2+]i with a novel flow-step protocol. [Ca2+]i increased with the onset of shear stress, but not after a step increase. However, the step increase in shear stress was associated with a potent biphasic increase in NO production rate and ecNOS phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that shear stress can increase NO production in the absence of increased [Ca2+]i, and they suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS may importantly modulate its activity during the imposition of increased shear stress.},

	Abstract = {Phosphorylation of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases) including CaM kinase Ialpha (CaM-K Ialpha), CaM kinase IIalpha (CaM-K IIalpha), and CaM kinase IV (CaM-K IV), was studied. It was found that purified recombinant nNOS was phosphorylated by CaM-K Ialpha, CaM-K IIalpha, and CaM-K IV at Ser847 in vitro. Replacement of Ser847 with Ala (S847A) prevented phosphorylation by CaM kinases. Phosphorylated recombinant wild-type nNOS at Ser847 (approximately 0.5 mol of phosphate incorporation into nNOS) exhibited a 30{\%} decrease of Vmax with little change of both the Km for L-arginine and Kact for CaM relative to unphosphorylated enzyme. The activity of mutant S847D was decreased to a level 50-60{\%} as much as the wild-type enzyme. The decreased NOS enzyme activity of phosphorylated nNOS at Ser847 and mutant S847D was partially due to suppression of CaM binding, but not to impairment of dimer formation which is thought to be essential for enzyme activation. Inactive nNOS lacking CaM-binding ability was generated by mutation of Lys732-Lys-Leu to Asp732-Asp-Glu (Watanabe, Y., Hu, Y., and Hidaka, H. (1997) FEBS Lett. 403, 75-78). It was phosphorylated by CaM kinases, as was the wild-type enzyme, indicating that CaM-nNOS binding was not required for the phosphorylation reaction. We developed antibody NP847, which specifically recognize nNOS in its phosphorylated state at Ser847. Using the antibody NP847, we obtained evidence that nNOS is phosphorylated at Ser847 in rat brain. Thus, our results suggest that CaM kinase-induced phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 alters the activity control of this enzyme.},

	Abstract = {Conducted vasodilatation (CVD) reflects the initiation and rapid ({\textgreater}mm s(-1)) spread of hyperpolarization along the endothelium and into smooth muscle. The ion channels that initiate CVD remain unclear as do signalling pathways that may complement electromechanical relaxation. Using isolated pressurized (75 mmHg; 37 degrees C) feed arteries (n=63; diameter: rest: 53 +/- 2 microm, maximal: 98 +/- 2 microm) from hamster retractor skeletal muscle, we investigated the contribution of calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa) and endothelium-derived autacoids to CVD. Local delivery (1 microm micropipette tip; 500-2000 ms pulse) of acetylcholine (ACh) at the downstream end initiated a local increase in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i (Fura-PE3; Deltaratio 340/380 nm = 0.215 +/- 0.032) that preceded CVD along the entire vessel. During local perifusion with KCa antagonists, iberiotoxin (5 microm) had no effect, but charybdotoxin (CTX, 5 microm) + apamin (APA, 10 microm) abolished CVD reversibly. Remarkably, this local inhibition of KCa unmasked a 'slow-conducted vasodilatation' (SCVD) that spread {\textgreater}1200 microm at approximately 21 microm s(-1) (n=27). Recorded 500 microm upstream from the ACh stimulus, a rise in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i (Deltaratio 340/380 nm) = 0.146 +/- 0.017; P{\textless}0.05) preceded SCVD (Deltadiameter = 14 +/- 3 microm) by approximately 10 s. Before KCa inhibition, antagonism of nitric oxide synthase (Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, 250 microm; l-NNA) and cyclooxygenase (indomethacin, 5 microm; INDO) had no effect on the amplitude of CVD yet response duration decreased by one-third (P{\textless}0.05). During local CTX + APA perifusion, L-NNA + INDO abolished SCVD while conducted [Ca2+]i responses remained intact. Thus, ACh triggers electromechanical relaxation of smooth muscle cells along the vessel initiated by local KCa, and the ensuing 'wave' of Ca2+ along the endothelium releases autacoids to promote pharmacomechanical relaxation.},

For waves having high positive curvature of wave fronts, a linear relationship between the curvature and their normal velocity was established, allowing computation of a diffusion coefficient of 1.9 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s for the autocatalytic species, which agrees well with results previously obtained for negatively curved wave fronts.

With a detailed but multifaceted knowledge of these patterns, neuroscientists and clinicians can better recognize the processes at play when age-related brain changes vary from these expectations. Employing a range of neuroimaging methods, genome-wide as well as focused gene targeting, and 'big data' computation, progress is occurring toward gaining such understanding. We are excited to present these articles as a special issue of Brain Imaging and Behavior which grew out of from our New Horizons in Human Brain Imaging meeting on the theme of the neuroimaging of brain aging, held in March 2013.},

	Abstract = {The classical model of metabolic regulation of blood flow in muscle tissue implies the maintenance of basal tone in arterioles of resting muscle and their dilation in response to exercise and/or tissue hypoxia via the evoked production of vasodilator metabolites by myocytes. A century-long effort to identify specific metabolites responsible for explaining active and reactive hyperemia has not been successful. Furthermore, the metabolic theory is not compatible with new knowledge on the role of physiological radicals (e.g., nitric oxide, NO, and superoxide anion, O2 (-) ) in the regulation of microvascular tone. We propose a model of regulation in which muscle contraction and active hyperemia are considered the physiologically normal state. We employ the "bang-bang" or "on/off" regulatory model which makes use of a threshold and hysteresis; a float valve to control the water level in a tank is a common example of this type of regulation. Active bang-bang regulation comes into effect when the supply of oxygen and glucose exceeds the demand, leading to activation of membrane NADPH oxidase, release of O2 (-) into the interstitial space and subsequent neutralization of the interstitial NO. Switching arterioles on/off when local blood flow crosses the threshold is realized by a local cell circuit with the properties of a bang-bang controller, determined by its threshold, hysteresis, and dead-band. This model provides a clear and unambiguous interpretation of the mechanism to balance tissue demand with a sufficient supply of nutrients and oxygen.},

@article{Ransom1995,
	Abstract = {1. Whole cell and cell-attached patch-clamp recordings were obtained from rat spinal cord astrocytes maintained in culture for 6-14 days. It was found that the resting conductance in these astrocytes is primarily due to inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels. 2. Two types of astrocytic Kir channels were identified with single-channel conductances of approximately 28 and approximately 80 pS, respectively. Channels displayed some voltage dependence in their open probability, which was largest (0.8-0.9) near the K+ equilibrium potential (Ek) and decreased at more negative potentials. The resting potential closely followed Ek, so it can be assumed that Kir channels have a high open probability at the resting potential. 3. The conductance of inwardly rectifying K+ currents (Kir) depended strongly on [K+]o and was approximately proportional to the square-root of [K+]o. 4. Kir currents inactivated in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. The Na+ dependence of inactivation was studied with ion substitution experiments. Replacement of [Na+]o with choline or Li+ removed inactivation. This dependence of current inactivation on [Na+]o resembles the previously described block of Kir channels in other systems by [Na+]o. 5. Kir currents were also blocked in a dose-dependent manner by Cs+ (Kd = 189 microM at -140 mV), Ba2+ (Kd = 3.5 microM), and tetraethylammonium (TEA; 90{\%} block at 10 mM) but were insensitive to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 5 mM). In the current-clamp mode, Ba2+ and TEA inhibition of Kir currents was associated with a marked depolarization, suggesting that Kir channel activity played a role in the establishment of the negative resting potential typical of astrocytes. 6. These biophysical features of astrocyte inwardly rectifying K+ channels are consistent with those properties required for their proposed involvement in [K+]o clearance: 1) high open probability at the resting potential, 2) increasing conductance with increasing [K+]o, and 3) rectification, e.g., channel closure, at positive potentials. It is proposed, therefore, that the dissipation of [K+]o following neuronal activity is mediated primarily by the activity of astrocytic Kir channels.},

	Abstract = {Sustained inward currents in neuronal membranes underlie tonic-clonic seizure discharges and spreading depression (SD). It is not known whether these currents flow through abnormally operating physiological ion channels or through pathological pathways that are not normally present. We have now used the NEURON simulating environment of Hines, Moore, and Carnevale to model seizure discharges and SD. The geometry and electrotonic properties of the model neuron conformed to a hippocampal pyramidal cell. Voltage-controlled transient and persistent sodium currents (I(Na,T) and I(Na,P)), potassium currents (I(K,DR) and I(K,A)), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-controlled currents (I(NMDA)), were inserted in the appropriate regions of the model cell. The neuron was surrounded by an interstitial space where extracellular potassium and sodium concentration ([K(+)](o) and [Na(+)](o)) could rise or fall. Changes in intra- and extracellular ion concentrations and the resulting shifts in the driving force for ionic currents were continuously computed based on the amount of current flowing through the membrane. A Na-K exchange pump operated to restore ion balances. In addition, extracellular potassium concentration, [K(+)](o), was also controlled by a "glial" uptake function. Parameters were chosen to resemble experimental data. As long as [K(+)](o) was kept within limits by the activity of the Na-K pump and the "glial" uptake, a depolarizing current pulse applied to the cell soma evoked repetitive firing that ceased when the stimulating current stopped. If, however, [K(+)](o) was allowed to rise, then a brief pulse provoked firing that outlasted the stimulus. At the termination of such a burst, the cell hyperpolarized and then slowly depolarized and another burst erupted without outside intervention. Such "clonic" bursting could continue indefinitely maintained by an interplay of the rise and fall of potassium and sodium concentrations with membrane currents and threshold levels. SD-like depolarization could be produced in two ways, 1) by a dendritic NMDA-controlled current. Glutamate was assumed to be released in response to rising [K(+)](o). And 2) by the persistent (i.e., slowly inactivating) Na-current, I(Na,P). When both I(NMDA) and I(Na,P) were present, the two acted synergistically. We conclude that epileptiform neuronal behavior and SD-like depolarization can be generated by the feedback of ion currents that change ion concentrations, which, in turn, influence ion currents and membrane potentials. The normal stability of brain function must depend on the efficient control of ion activities, especially that of [K(+)](o).},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: P2Y receptors evoke Ca(2+) signals in vascular smooth muscle cells and regulate contraction and proliferation, but the roles of the different P2Y receptor subtypes are incompletely resolved. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Quantitative PCR was used to define expression of mRNA encoding P2Y receptor subtypes in freshly isolated and cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC). Fluorescent indicators in combination with selective ligands were used to measure the changes in cytosolic free [Ca(2+)] in cultured ASMC evoked by each P2Y receptor subtype. KEY RESULTS: The mRNA for all rat P2Y receptor subtypes are expressed at various levels in cultured ASMC. Four P2Y receptor subtypes (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4 and P2Y6) evoke Ca(2+) signals that require activation of phospholipase C and comprise both release of Ca(2+) from stores and Ca(2+) entry across the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Combining analysis of P2Y receptor expression with functional analyses using selective agonists and antagonists, we isolated the Ca(2+) signals evoked in ASMC by activation of P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4 and P2Y6 receptors.},

	Abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slow-moving ionic and metabolic disturbance that propagates in cortical brain tissue. In addition to massive cellular depolarizations, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and metabolism-aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on modeling the features essential to understanding the implications of neurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium-ATPase, mainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a rate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is determined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an effective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium concentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex exceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of vascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation play important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model replicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD--vasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation, prolonged depolarization--found in experimental studies. We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the contribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the variability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These results have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more precise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly relevant to neurological disease.},

Here, we review work showing that neurovascular coupling and brain circuit function in the awake animal are profoundly different from those in the anesthetized state. We argue that the time is right to study neurovascular coupling and brain circuit function in the awake animal to bridge the physiological mechanisms that underlie animal and human neuroimaging signals, and to interpret them in light of underlying neural mechanisms. Lastly, we discuss recent experimental innovations that have enabled the study of neurovascular coupling and brain-wide circuit function in un-anesthetized and behaving animal models.},

	Abstract = {Evidence that Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (K(Ca)) channels play a role in cell volume changes and K(+) homeostasis led to a prediction that astrocytes would have K(Ca) channels near blood vessels in order to maintain K(+) homeostasis. Consistent with this thinking the present study demonstrates that rSlo K(Ca) channels are in glial cells of the adult rat central nervous system (CNS) and highly localized to specializations of astrocytes associated with the brain vasculature. Using confocal and thin-section electron microscopic immunolabeling methods the distribution of rSlo was examined in adult rat brain. Strong rSlo immunolabeling was present around the vasculature of most brain regions. Examination of dye-filled hippocampal astrocytes revealed rSlo immunolabeling polarized in astrocytic endfeet. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed that the rSlo staining was concentrated in astrocytic endfeet ensheathing capillaries as well as abutting the pia mater. Immunostaining within the endfeet was predominantly distributed at the plasma membrane directly adjacent to either the vascular basal lamina or the pial surface. The distribution of the aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) water channel was also examined using dye-filled hippocampal astrocytes. In confirmation of earlier reports, intense AQP-4 immunolabeling was generally observed at the perimeter of blood vessels, and coincided with perivascular endfeet and rSlo labeling. We propose that rSlo K(Ca) channels, with their sensitivity to membrane depolarization and intracellular calcium, play a role in the K(+) modulation of cerebral blood flow. Additional knowledge of the molecular and cellular machinery present at perivascular endfeet may provide insight into the structural and functional molecular elements responsible for the neuronal activity-dependent regulation of cerebral blood flow.},

	Abstract = {Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has devastating consequences on brain function including profound effects on communication between neurons and the vasculature leading to cerebral ischemia. Physiologically, neurovascular coupling represents a focal increase in cerebral blood flow to meet increased metabolic demand of neurons within active regions of the brain. Neurovascular coupling is an ongoing process involving coordinated activity of the neurovascular unit-neurons, astrocytes, and parenchymal arterioles. Neuronal activity can also influence cerebral blood flow on a larger scale. Spreading depolarizations (SD) are self-propagating waves of neuronal depolarization and are observed during migraine, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. Typically, SD is associated with increased cerebral blood flow. Emerging evidence indicates that SAH causes inversion of neurovascular communication on both the local and global level. In contrast to other events causing SD, SAH-induced SD decreases rather than increases cerebral blood flow. Further, at the level of the neurovascular unit, SAH causes an inversion of neurovascular coupling from vasodilation to vasoconstriction. Global ischemia can also adversely affect the neurovascular response. Here, we summarize current knowledge regarding the impact of SAH and global ischemia on neurovascular communication. A mechanistic understanding of these events should provide novel strategies to treat these neurovascular disorders.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+-triggered synchronous neurotransmitter release is well described, but asynchronous release-in fact, its very existence-remains enigmatic. Here we report a quantitative description of asynchronous neurotransmitter release in calyx-of-Held synapses. We show that deletion of synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) in mice selectively abolishes synchronous release, allowing us to study pure asynchronous release in isolation. Using photolysis experiments of caged Ca2+, we demonstrate that asynchronous release displays a Ca2+ cooperativity of approximately 2 with a Ca2+ affinity of approximately 44 microM, in contrast to synchronous release, which exhibits a Ca2+ cooperativity of approximately 5 with a Ca2+ affinity of approximately 38 muM. Our results reveal that release triggered in wild-type synapses at low Ca2+ concentrations is physiologically asynchronous, and that asynchronous release completely empties the readily releasable pool of vesicles during sustained elevations of Ca2+. We propose a dual-Ca2+-sensor model of release that quantitatively describes the contributions of synchronous and asynchronous release under conditions of different presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persons with certain neurological conditions have higher mortality rates than the population without neurological conditions, but the risk factors for increased mortality within diagnostic groups are less well understood. The interRAI CHESS scale has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality in the overall population of persons receiving health care in community and institutional settings. This study examines the performance of CHESS as a predictor of mortality among persons with 11 different neurological conditions.

METHODS: Survival analyses were done with interRAI assessments linked to mortality data among persons in home care (n = 359,940), complex continuing care hospitals/units (n = 88,721), and nursing homes (n = 185,309) in seven Canadian provinces/territories.

RESULTS: CHESS was a significant predictor of mortality in all 3 care settings for the 11 neurological diagnostic groups considered after adjusting for age and sex. The distribution of CHESS scores varied between diagnostic groups and within diagnostic groups in different care settings.

CONCLUSIONS: CHESS is a valid predictor of mortality in neurological populations in community and institutional care. It may prove useful for several clinical, administrative, policy-development, evaluation and research purposes. Because it is routinely gathered as part of normal clinical practice in jurisdictions (like Canada) that have implemented interRAI assessment instruments, CHESS can be derived without additional need for data collection.},

	Abstract = {The properties and roles of ATP-sensitive (KATP) and inwardly rectifying (KIR) potassium channels are reviewed. Potassium channels regulate the membrane potential of smooth muscle, which controls calcium entry through voltage-dependent calcium channels, and thereby contractility through changes in intracellular calcium. The KATP channel is likely to be composed of members of the inward rectifier channel gene family (Kir6) and sulfonylurea receptor proteins. The KIR channels do not appear to be as widely distributed as KATP channels in smooth muscle and may provide a mechanism by which changes in extracellular K+ can alter smooth muscle membrane potential, and thereby arterial diameter. The KATP channels contribute to the resting membrane conductance of some types of smooth muscle and can open under situations of metabolic compromise. The KATP channels are targets of a wide variety of vasodilators and constrictors, which act, respectively, through adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/protein kinase A and protein kinase C. The KATP channels are also activated by a number of synthetic vasodilators (e.g., diazoxide and pinacidil) and are inhibited by the oral hypoglycemic sulfonylurea drugs (e.g., glibenclamide). Together, KATP and KIR channels are important regulators of smooth muscle function and represent important therapeutic targets.},

@article{Hoffmeyer2007,
	Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging and normal brain function rely on the robust coupling between neural activity and cerebral blood flow (CBF), that is neurovascular coupling. We examined neurovascular coupling in rat sensory cortex in response to direct stimulation of transcallosal pathways, which allows examination of brain regions inaccessible to peripheral stimulation techniques. Using laser-Doppler flowmetry to record CBF and electrophysiologic recordings of local field potentials (LFPs), we show an exponential relation between CBF responses and summed LFP amplitudes. Hemodynamic responses were dependent on glutamate receptor activation. CNQX, an AMPA receptor blocker, strongly attenuated evoked CBF responses and LFP amplitudes at all stimulation frequencies. In comparison, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade by MK801 attenuated CBF responses at high ({\textgreater}7 Hz) but not low ({\textless}7 Hz) stimulation frequencies, without affecting evoked LFP amplitudes. This shows the limitation of using LFP amplitudes as indicators of synaptic activity. 7-Nitroindazole, a neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and indomethacin, a nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, attenuated the hemodynamic responses by 50{\%}+/-1{\%} and 48{\%}+/-1{\%}, respectively, without affecting LFP amplitudes. The data suggest that preserved activity of both AMPA and NMDA receptors is necessary for the full CBF response evoked by stimulation of rodent interhemispheric connections. AMPA receptor activation gives rise to a measurable LFP, but NMDA receptor activation does not. The lack of a measurable LFP from neural processes that contribute importantly to CBF may explain some of the difficulties in transforming extracellular current or voltage measurements to a hemodynamic response.},

	Abstract = {Blood flow is adjusted to tissue demand through rapidly ascending vasodilatations resulting from conduction of hyperpolarisation through vascular gap junctions. We investigated how these dilatations can spread without attenuation if mediated by an electrical signal. Cremaster muscle arterioles were studied in vivo by simultaneously measuring membrane potential and vessel diameter. Focal application of acetylcholine elicited hyperpolarisations which decayed passively with distance from the local site,while dilatation spread upstream without attenuation. Analysis of simultaneous recordings at the local site revealed that hyperpolarisation and dilatation were only linearly related over a restricted voltage range to a threshold potential, beyond which dilatation was maximal. Experimental data could be simulated in a computational model with electrotonic decay of hyperpolarisation but imposition of this threshold. The model was tested by reducing the amplitude of the local hyperpolarisation which led to entry into the linear range closer to the local site and decay of dilatation. Serial section electron microscopy and light dye treatment confirmed that the spread of dilatation occurred through the endothelium and that the two cell layers were tightly coupled. Generality of the mechanism was demonstrated by applying the model to the attenuated propagation of dilatation found in larger arteries.We conclude that long distance spread of locally initiated dilatations is not due to a regenerative electrical phenomenon, but rather a restricted linear relationship between voltage and vessel tone, which minimises the impact of electrotonic decay of voltage. Disease-related alterations in endothelial coupling or ion channel expression could therefore decrease the ability to adjust blood flow to meet metabolic demand.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Lung inflammation is present in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and interstitial lung disease (ILD), but the mechanisms linking inflammatory and fibrotic processes in ILD are unknown. Our aim was to investigate whether alveolar inflammation, reflected by increased alveolar concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (C(A)NO), is related to the ability of serum from patients with SSc to induce pulmonary fibroblast proliferation (PFP) and myofibroblast conversion. METHODS: C(A)NO was measured in all subjects (37 patients with SSc and 10 healthy controls) whose sera were used to stimulate PFP (assessed by BrdU labeling index) and myofibroblast conversion (detected by alpha-smooth muscle actin expression). The PFP index in patients with SSc was compared to control values, and between patients with SSc who had elevated ({\textgreater} 4.3 ppb) and normal ({\textless}or= 4.3 ppb) C(A)NO values. RESULTS: Both C(A)NO and the PFP index were significantly greater in patients with SSc compared to controls. In patients with SSc, the PFP index was directly related to C(A)NO levels (r = 0.48; p = 0.002). The median PFP index was significantly higher in patients with SSc who had elevated C(A)NO ({\textgreater} 4.3 ppb; n = 25, median 1.1, range 0.98-1.23) than in patients with SSc who had normal C(A)NO ({\textless}or= 4.3 ppb; n = 12, median 0.93, range 0.82-1.08; p = 0.01). Similarly, myofibroblast conversion induced by SSc serum was significantly greater in patients with C(A)NO {\textgreater} 4.3 ppb than in patients whose C(A)NO was {\textless}or= 4.3 ppb (p {\textless} 0.001) and controls (p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Alveolar inflammation reflected by increased nitric oxide production was related to serum-induced PFP and myofibroblast conversion, linking the active alveolitis process to cell proliferation and lung fibrosis in patients with SSc.},

	Abstract = {We developed a new technique to estimate the aortic pressure (AP) waveform from a single peripheral artery pressure (PAP) waveform. The technique 1) employs a parallel tube model of the arterial tree to establish a transfer function relating PAP to AP with unknown parameters; 2) estimates the parameters from the measured PAP waveform, along with a single non-invasive measurement of the wave transmission delay from the aorta to the peripheral artery measurement site, by exploiting the fact that aortic flow is zero during diastole; and 3) applies the transfer function to the PAP waveform to predict the unmeasured AP waveform. In this way, in contrast to the conventional generalized transfer function paradigm, the transfer function is able to adapt to the inter-subject and temporal variability of the arterial tree. We applied this adaptive transfer function technique to PAP waveforms measured from five dogs instrumented with reference AP catheters during various hemodynamic interventions. Our results showed that the technique was able to reliably estimate the AP waveform with an overall error of 4.2 mmHg. For comparison, the corresponding errors of two previously proposed generalized transfer functions trained on a subset of the same canine data were, on average, 19{\%} larger.},

@article{Cui1997,
	Abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit.

	Abstract = {Recent studies from our group and others using quantitative fMRI methods have found that variations of the coupling ratio of blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) responses to a stimulus have a strong effect on the BOLD response. Across a number of studies an empirical pattern is emerging in the way CBF and CMRO2 changes are coupled to neural activation: if the stimulus is modulated to create a stronger response (e.g., increasing stimulus contrast), CBF is modulated more than CMRO2; on the other hand, if the brain state is altered such that the response to the same stimulus is increased (e.g., modulating attention, adaptation, or excitability), CMRO2 is modulated more than CBF. Because CBF and CMRO2 changes conflict in producing BOLD signal changes, this finding has an important implication for conventional BOLD-fMRI studies: the BOLD response exaggerates the effects of stimulus variation but is only weakly sensitive to modulations of the brain state that alter the response to a standard stimulus. A speculative hypothesis is that variability of the coupling ratio of the CBF and CMRO2 responses reflects different proportions of inhibitory and excitatory evoked activity, potentially providing a new window on neural activity in the human brain.},

	Abstract = {The whisker-to-barrel cortex is widely used to study neurovascular coupling, but the cellular basis that underlies the perfusion changes is still largely unknown. Here, we identified neurons recruited by whisker stimulation in the rat somatosensory cortex using double immunohistochemistry for c-Fos and markers of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and investigated in vivo their contribution along with that of astrocytes in the evoked perfusion response. Whisker stimulation elicited cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases concomitantly with c-Fos upregulation in pyramidal cells that coexpressed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and GABA interneurons that coexpressed vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and/or choline acetyltransferase, but not somatostatin or parvalbumin. The evoked CBF response was decreased by blockade of NMDA (MK-801, -37{\%}), group I metabotropic glutamate (MPEP+LY367385, -40{\%}), and GABA-A (picrotoxin, -31{\%}) receptors, but not by GABA-B, VIP, or muscarinic receptor antagonism. Picrotoxin decreased stimulus-induced somatosensory evoked potentials and CBF responses. Combined blockade of GABA-A and NMDA receptors yielded an additive decreasing effect (-61{\%}) of the evoked CBF compared with each antagonist alone, demonstrating cooperation of both excitatory and inhibitory systems in the hyperemic response. Blockade of prostanoid synthesis by inhibiting COX-2 (indomethacin, NS-398), expressed by ∼40{\%} of pyramidal cells but not by astrocytes, impaired the CBF response (-50{\%}). The hyperemic response was also reduced (-40{\%}) after inhibition of astroglial oxidative metabolism or epoxyeicosatrienoic acids synthesis. These results demonstrate that changes in pyramidal cell activity, sculpted by specific types of inhibitory GABA interneurons, drive the CBF response to whisker stimulation and, further, that metabolically active astrocytes are also required.},

@article{Searls2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diminished calcium (Ca2+) transients in response to physiological agonists have been reported in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from diabetic animals. However, the mechanism responsible was unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: VSMCs from autoimmune type 1 Diabetes Resistant Bio-Breeding (DR-BB) rats and streptozotocin-induced rats were examined for levels and distribution of inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and the SR Ca2+ pumps (SERCA 2 and 3). Generally, a decrease in IP3R levels and dramatic increase in ryanodine receptor (RyR) levels were noted in the aortic samples from diabetic animals. Redistribution of the specific IP3R subtypes was dependent on the rat model. SERCA 2 was redistributed to a peri-nuclear pattern that was more prominent in the DR-BB diabetic rat aorta than the STZ diabetic rat. The free intracellular Ca2+ in freshly dispersed VSMCs from control and diabetic animals was monitored using ratiometric Ca2+ sensitive fluorophores viewed by confocal microscopy. In control VSMCs, basal fluorescence levels were significantly higher in the nucleus relative to the cytoplasm, while in diabetic VSMCs they were essentially the same. Vasopressin induced a predictable increase in free intracellular Ca2+ in the VSMCs from control rats with a prolonged and significantly blunted response in the diabetic VSMCs. A slow rise in free intracellular Ca2+ in response to thapsigargin, a specific blocker of SERCA was seen in the control VSMCs but was significantly delayed and prolonged in cells from diabetic rats. To determine whether the changes were due to the direct effects of hyperglycemica, experiments were repeated using cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) grown in hyperglycemic and control conditions. In general, they demonstrated the same changes in protein levels and distribution as well as the blunted Ca2+ responses to vasopressin and thapsigargin as noted in the cells from diabetic animals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates that the previously-reported reduced Ca2+ signaling in VSMCs from diabetic animals is related to decreases and/or redistribution in the IP3R Ca2+ channels and SERCA proteins. These changes can be duplicated in culture with high glucose levels.},

	Abstract = {An increase in tissue blood flow requires relaxation of smooth muscle cells along entire branches of the resistance vasculature. Whereas the spread of hyperpolarization along the endothelium can coordinate smooth muscle cell relaxation, complementary signaling events have been implicated in the conduction of vasodilation. We tested the hypothesis that Ca(2+) waves propagate from cell to cell along the endothelium of feed arteries exhibiting spontaneous vasomotor tone. Feed arteries of the hamster retractor muscle were isolated, pressurized to 75 mmHg at 37 degrees C, and developed myogenic tone spontaneously. Smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells were loaded with the Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-4. An acetylcholine stimulus was delivered locally using microiontophoresis (1-microm pipette tip, 1 microA, 1 s), and Ca(2+) signaling within and along respective cell layers was determined using laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Acetylcholine triggered an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) of endothelial cells at the site of stimulation that preceded two distinct events: 1) a rapid synchronous decrease in smooth muscle [Ca(2+)](i) along the entire vessel and 2) an ensuing Ca(2+) wave that propagated bidirectionally along the endothelium at approximately 111 microm/s for distances exceeding 1 mm. Maximal dilation of vessels with either nifedipine (1 microM) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 100 microM) reduced the distance that Ca(2+) waves traveled to approximately 300 microm (P {\textless}0.05). Thus Ca(2+) waves propagate along the endothelium of resistance vessels with vasomotor tone, and this signaling pathway is compromised during maximal dilation with nifedipine or SNP.},

	Abstract = {Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1????M/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The time courses of the NBR and PBR were similar, and their amplitudes covaried both with increasing stimulus duration and increasing stimulus contrast. The NBR was associated with reductions in blood flow and with decreases in oxygen consumption. Our findings support the contribution to the NBR of (1) a significant component of reduction in neuronal activity and (2) possibly a component of hemodynamic changes independent of the local changes in neuronal activity.},

	Abstract = {Neural synchronization is considered as an important mechanism for information processing. In addition, based on recent neurophysiologic findings, it is believed that astrocytes regulate the synaptic transmission of neuronal networks. Therefore, the present study focused on determining the functional contribution of astrocytes in neuronal synchrony using both computer simulations and extracellular field potential recordings. For computer simulations, as a first step, a minimal network model is constructed by connecting two Morris-Lecar neuronal models. In this minimal model, astrocyte-neuron interactions are considered in a functional-based procedure. Next, the minimal network is extended and a biologically plausible neuronal population model is developed which considers functional outcome of astrocyte-neuron interactions too. The employed structure is based on the physiological and anatomical network properties of the hippocampal CA1 area. Utilizing these two different levels of modeling, it is demonstrated that astrocytes are able to change the threshold value of transition from synchronous to asynchronous behavior among neurons. In this way, variations in the interaction between astrocytes and neurons lead to the emergence of synchronous/asynchronous patterns in neural responses. Furthermore, population spikes are recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices to validate the modeling results. It demonstrates that astrocytes play a primary role in neuronal firing synchronicity and synaptic coordination. These results may offer a new insight into understanding the mechanism by which astrocytes contribute to stabilizing neural activities.},

	Abstract = {Studies of stress effects on the brain have traditionally focused on neurons, without considering the cerebral microcirculation. Here we report that stress impairs neurovascular coupling (NVC), the process that matches neuronal activity with increased local blood flow. A stressed phenotype was induced in male rats by administering a 7-d heterotypical stress paradigm. NVC was modeled by measuring parenchymal arteriole (PA) vasodilation in response to neuronal stimulation in amygdala brain slices. After stress, vasodilation of PAs to neuronal stimulation was greatly reduced, and dilation of isolated PAs to external K(+) was diminished, suggesting a defect in smooth muscle inwardly rectifying K(+) (KIR) channel function. Consistent with these observations, stress caused a reduction in PA KIR2.1 mRNA and smooth muscle KIR current density, and blocking KIR channels significantly inhibited NVC in control, but not in stressed, slices. Delivery of corticosterone for 7 d (without stressors) or RU486 (before stressors) mimicked and abrogated NVC impairment by stress, respectively. We conclude that stress causes a glucocorticoid-mediated decrease in functional KIR channels in amygdala PA myocytes. This renders arterioles less responsive to K(+) released from astrocytic endfeet during NVC, leading to impairment of this process. Because the fidelity of NVC is essential for neuronal health, the impairment characterized here may contribute to the pathophysiology of brain disorders with a stress component.},

@article{Ho2012a,
	Abstract = {Slow population activities (SPAs) exist in the brain and have frequencies below ∼5 Hz. Despite SPAs being prominent in several cortical areas and serving many putative functions, their mechanisms are not well understood. We studied a specific type of in vitro GABAergic, inhibition-based SPA exhibited by C57BL/6 murine hippocampus. We used a multipronged approach consisting of experiment, simulation, and mathematical analyses to uncover mechanisms responsible for hippocampal SPAs. Our results show that hippocampal SPAs are an emergent phenomenon in which the ``slowness'' of the network is due to interactions between synaptic and cellular characteristics of individual fast-spiking, inhibitory interneurons. Our simulations quantify characteristics underlying hippocampal SPAs. In particular, for hippocampal SPAs to occur, we predict that individual fast-spiking interneurons should have frequency--current (f--I) curves that exhibit a suitably sized kink where the slope of the curve decreases more abruptly in the gamma frequency range with increasing current. We also predict that these interneurons should be well connected with one another. Our mathematical analyses show that the combination of synaptic and intrinsic conditions, as predicted by our simulations, promotes network multistability. Population slow timescales occur when excitatory fluctuations drive the network between different stable network firing states. Since many of the parameters we use are extracted from experiments and subsequent measurements of experimental f--I curves of fast-spiking interneurons exhibit characteristics as predicted, we propose that our network models capture a fundamental operating mechanism in biological hippocampal networks.},

	Abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has been suggested to underlie migraine visual aura. However, it has been challenging to test this hypothesis in human cerebral cortex. Using high-field functional MRI with near-continuous recording during visual aura in three subjects, we observed blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes that demonstrated at least eight characteristics of CSD, time-locked to percept/onset of the aura. Initially, a focal increase in BOLD signal (possibly reflecting vasodilation), developed within extrastriate cortex (area V3A). This BOLD change progressed contiguously and slowly (3.5 +/- 1.1 mm/min) over occipital cortex, congruent with the retinotopy of the visual percept. Following the same retinotopic progression, the BOLD signal then diminished (possibly reflecting vasoconstriction after the initial vasodilation), as did the BOLD response to visual activation. During periods with no visual stimulation, but while the subject was experiencing scintillations, BOLD signal followed the retinotopic progression of the visual percept. These data strongly suggest that an electrophysiological event such as CSD generates the aura in human visual cortex.},

It is activated by a variety of physical and chemical stimuli, including heat, mechano-stimuli, endogenous substances such as arachidonic acid and its cytochrome P450-derived metabolites (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids), endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol), as well as synthetic ??-phorbol derivatives. Recently, TRPV4 has been characterized as an important player modulating osteoclast differentiation in bone remodelling and as a urothelial mechanosensor that controls normal voiding. Several TRPV4 gain-of-function mutations are shown to cause autosomal-dominant bone dysplasias such as brachyolmia and Koszlowski disease. In this review we comprehensively describe the structural, biophysical and (patho)physiological properties of the TRPV4 channel and we summarize the current knowledge about the role of TRPV4 in the pathogenesis of several diseases. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has an important role in migraine with aura. Prolonged neuronal depression is followed by a late excitatory synaptic plasticity after CSD.

METHOD: Intra- and extracellular recordings were performed to investigate the effect of CSD on intracellular properties of mouse neocortical tissues in the late excitatory period.

RESULTS: During CSD, changes in the membrane potentials usually began with a relatively short hyperpolarization followed by an abrupt depolarization. These changes occurred roughly at the same time point after CSD as the beginning of the negative extracellular deflection. Forty-five minutes after CSD, neurons showed significantly smaller amplitude of afterhyperpolarization and a reduced input resistance. Depolarization and hyperpolarization of the cells by constant intracellular current injections in this period significantly changed the frequency of the action potentials.

CONCLUSION: These data indicate higher excitability of the neocortical neurons after CSD, which can be assumed to contribute to hyperexcitability of neocortical tissues in patients suffering from migraine.},

	Abstract = {The response of a model microelectrochemical system to a time-dependent applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate blocking electrodes, which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The "weakly nonlinear" limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions in the small parameter epsilon= lambdaD/L, where lambdaD is the screening length and L the electrode separation. At leading order, the system initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of lambdaDL/D (not lambdaD2/D), where D is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity violates this common picture and introduces multiple time scales. The charging process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, L2/D. In the "strongly nonlinear" regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface conduction, multicomponent electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.},

	Abstract = {Under parametric variations, the phase portraits of a dynamical system such as a power system undergoes qualitative changes at bifurcation points. Several global codimension-two bifurcation points such as Zero-Hopf, generalized Hopf, Bogdanov-Takens, among others, can move the system much close to its instability limit, and lead to chaos. Due to this fact, there has been major effort in understanding these instability phenomena, in order to design control and preventive actions for power systems. In this paper, the dynamics of a straightforward system which includes a single machine-infinite bus power system (SMIB) is analyzed. The system is forced to operate under several conditions in order to study its behavior close to codimension-two bifurcation points. This paper is specifically oriented to analyze the Zero-Hopf and the Bogdanov Takens bifurcations, which contributes significantly to the system dynamics.},

@article{Lajoix2004,
	Abstract = {We previously showed that pancreatic beta-cells express a neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) that controls insulin secretion by exerting two enzymatic activities: nitric oxide (NO) production and cytochrome c reductase activity. We now bring evidence that two inhibitors of nNOS, N-omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), increase glucose-induced insulin secretion but affect beta-cell function differently. In the presence of l-NAME, insulin response is monophasic, whereas 7-NI preserves the normal biphasic secretory pattern. In addition, the alterations of beta-cell functional response induced by the inhibitors also differ by their sensitivity to a substitutive treatment with sodium nitroprusside, a chemical NO donor. These differences are probably related to the nature of the two inhibitors. Indeed, using low-temperature SDS-PAGE and real-time analysis of nNOS dimerization by surface plasmon resonance, we could show that 7-NI, which competes with arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor for nNOS dimer formation, inhibits dimerization of the enzyme, whereas the substrate-based inhibitor l-NAME stabilizes the homodimeric state of nNOS. The latter effect could be reproduced by the two endogenous inhibitors of NOS, N-omega-methyl-l-arginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine, and resulted interestingly in a reduced ability of the protein inhibitor of nNOS (PIN) to dissociate nNOS dimers. We conclude that intracellular factors able to induce abnormalities in the nNOS monomer/dimer equilibrium could lead to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.},

	Abstract = {Mechanical and osmotic sensitivity of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel depends on phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activation and the subsequent production of the arachidonic acid metabolites, epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET). We show that both high viscous loading and hypotonicity stimuli in native ciliated epithelial cells use PLA(2)-EET as the primary pathway to activate TRPV4. Under conditions of low PLA(2) activation, both also use extracellular ATP-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) signaling to support TRPV4 gating. IP(3), without being an agonist itself, sensitizes TRPV4 to EET in epithelial ciliated cells and cells heterologously expressing TRPV4, an effect inhibited by the IP(3) receptor antagonist xestospongin C. Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated a physical interaction between TRPV4 and IP(3) receptor 3. Collectively, our study suggests a functional coupling between plasma membrane TRPV4 channels and intracellular store Ca(2+) channels required to initiate and maintain the oscillatory Ca(2+) signal triggered by high viscosity and hypotonic stimuli that do not reach a threshold level of PLA(2) activation.},

	Abstract = {Brain imaging techniques rely on changes in blood flow, volume and oxygenation to infer the loci and magnitude of changes in activity. Although progress has been made in understanding the link between stimulus-evoked neural activity and haemodynamics, the extent to which neurovascular-coupling relationships remain constant during different states of baseline cortical activity is poorly understood. Optical imaging spectroscopy, laser Doppler flowmetry and electrophysiology were used to measure haemodynamics and neural activity in the barrel cortex of anaesthetized rats. The responses to stimulation of the whisker pad were recorded during quiescence and cortical desynchronization produced by stimulation of the brainstem. Cortical desynchronization was accompanied by increases in baseline blood flow, volume and oxygenation. Haemodynamic responses to low-frequency whisker stimuli (1 Hz) were attenuated during arousal compared with that observed during quiescence. During arousal it was possible to increase stimulus-evoked haemodynamics by increasing the frequency of the stimulus. Neural responses to low-frequency stimuli were also attenuated but to a far lesser extent than the reduction in the accompanying haemodynamics. In contrast, neuronal activity evoked by high-frequency stimuli (40 Hz) was enhanced during arousal, but induced haemodynamic responses of a similar magnitude compared with that observed for the same high-frequency stimulus presented during quiescence. These data suggest that there may be differences in stimulus-evoked neural activity and accompanying haemodynamics during different information-processing states.},

	Abstract = {1. To study the effects of brief periods of hypoxia on cellular functions in the rat hippocampal slice, extracellular and intracellular recordings were made from pyramidal neurons, and interstitial potassium activity ([K+]o) was measured in the pyramidal cell layers. Slices were perfused in an interface chamber at 36-37 degrees C with medium containing 8.5 mM [K+]o. Hypoxia was induced by switching the overflow gas from O2-CO2 to N2-CO2. 2. Brief periods of hypoxia (5-60 s) produced electrographic seizures with typical tonic and clonic components in 53{\%} of 293 slices that generated spontaneous interictal bursts. Hypoxia-induced seizures were usually initiated in and restricted to the Ca1 region; only 2.5{\%} of these slices generated seizures in CA3. In contrast to the CA1 region, the CA3 region could undergo spreading depression during hypoxia. The probability of seizure generation in CA1 was increased with increasing duration of hypoxia and was greatly reduced by lowering the bath temperature a few degrees. 3. [K+]o gradually increased in the CA1 and CA3 cell layers during the 20 s leading up to an hypoxia-induced seizure. [K+]o rose to approximately 9.8 mM (from a base line of 8.5 mM) in CA1 just before a seizure and to 11.4 mM during the seizure. After hypoxia, [K+]o reached a higher level in CA1 than in CA3, regardless of whether 1 microM tetrodotoxin was present to eliminate differences in cell firing in the two regions. CA1 pyramidal cells and glia gradually depolarized by several millivolts during and after hypoxia; no initial hyperpolarizing phase was detected. 4. Burst input from CA3 was necessary for hypoxia-induced seizures. The frequency and intensity of spontaneous burst-firing in CA3 remained steady in the period leading up to a CA1 seizure episode. In contrast, the intensity of synaptically driven bursts in CA1 grew markedly just before seizure onset. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors participated in the crescendo of increasingly synchronous activity in CA1, because the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV, 30 microM), stereoselectively reduced seizure intensity. 5. Hypoxia-induced seizures were followed by a depressant phase, which was manifested most prominently by a prolonged (up to several minutes) reduction in the frequency and intensity of burst-firing in the CA3 region, hyperpolarization of CA1 neurons, and undershoot of [K+]o. In normal (3.5 mM) [K+]o, synaptically driven population spikes in CA1 were only reduced in amplitude by hypoxia; hypoxia did not induce seizures in 3.5 mM [K+]o.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning. METHODS: In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980-2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged {\textgreater}/=60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions. RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence for those aged {\textgreater}/=60 years varied in a narrow band, 5{\%}-7{\%} in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5{\%}), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2{\%}-4{\%}). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58{\%} of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63{\%} in 2030 and 71{\%} in 2050. CONCLUSION: The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression). All countries need to commission nationally representative surveys that are repeated regularly to monitor trends.},

	Abstract = {The brain possesses two intricate mechanisms that fulfill its continuous metabolic needs: cerebral autoregulation, which ensures constant cerebral blood flow over a wide range of arterial pressures and functional hyperemia, which ensures rapid delivery of oxygen and glucose to active neurons. Over the past decade, a number of important studies have identified astrocytes as key intermediaries in neurovascular coupling (NVC), the mechanism by which active neurons signal blood vessels to change their diameter. Activity-dependent increases in astrocytic Ca2+ activity are thought to contribute to the release of vasoactive substances that facilitate arteriole vasodilation. A number of vasoactive signals have been identified and their role on vessel caliber assessed both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss mechanisms implicating astrocytes in NVC-mediated vascular responses, limitations encountered as a result of the challenges in maintaining all the constituents of the neurovascular unit intact and deliberate current controversial findings disputing a main role for astrocytes in NVC. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential role of pericytes and microglia in NVC-mediated processes.},

	Abstract = {Quantification of nonlinear interactions between two nonstationary signals presents a computational challenge in different research fields, especially for assessments of physiological systems. Traditional approaches that are based on theories of stationary signals cannot resolve nonstationarity-related issues and, thus, cannot reliably assess nonlinear interactions in physiological systems. In this review we discuss a new technique "Multi-Modal Pressure Flow method (MMPF)" that utilizes Hilbert-Huang transformation to quantify dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) by studying interaction between nonstationary cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) and blood pressure (BP). CA is an important mechanism responsible for controlling cerebral blood flow in responses to fluctuations in systemic BP within a few heart-beats. The influence of CA is traditionally assessed from the relationship between the well-pronounced systemic BP and BFV oscillations induced by clinical tests. Reliable noninvasive assessment of dynamic CA, however, remains a challenge in clinical and diagnostic medicine.In this brief review we: 1) present an overview of transfer function analysis (TFA) that is traditionally used to quantify CA; 2) describe the a MMPF method and its modifications; 3) introduce a newly developed automatic algorithm and engineering aspects of the improved MMPF method; and 4) review clinical applications of MMPF and its sensitivity for detection of CA abnormalities in clinical studies. The MMPF analysis decomposes complex nonstationary BP and BFV signals into multiple empirical modes adaptively so that the fluctuations caused by a specific physiologic process can be represented in a corresponding empirical mode. Using this technique, we recently showed that dynamic CA can be characterized by specific phase delays between the decomposed BP and BFV oscillations, and that the phase shifts are significantly reduced in hypertensive, diabetics and stroke subjects with impaired CA. In addition, the new technique enables reliable assessment of CA using both data collected during clinical test and spontaneous BP/BFV fluctuations during baseline resting conditions.},

	Abstract = {The coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is essential for normal brain function. The mechanisms behind this neurovascular coupling process remain elusive, mainly because of difficulties in probing dynamically the functional and coordinated interaction between neurons and the vasculature in vivo. Direct and simultaneous measurements of nitric oxide (NO) dynamics and CBF changes in hippocampus in vivo support the notion that during glutamatergic activation nNOS-derived NO induces a time-, space-, and amplitude-coupled increase in the local CBF, later followed by a transient increase in local O2 tension. These events are dependent on the activation of the NMDA-glutamate receptor and nNOS, without a significant contribution of endothelial-derived NO or astrocyte-neuron signaling pathways. Upon diffusion of NO from active neurons, the vascular response encompasses the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. Hence, in the hippocampus, neurovascular coupling is mediated by nNOS-derived NO via a diffusional connection between active glutamatergic neurons and blood vessels. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {New strategies for introducing genetically encoded activity indicators into animal models facilitate the investigation of nervous system function. We have developed the PC::G5-tdT mouse line that expresses the GCaMP5G calcium indicator in a Cre-dependent fashion. Instead of targeting the ROSA26 locus, we inserted the reporter cassette nearby the ubiquitously expressed Polr2a gene without disrupting locus integrity. The indicator was tagged with IRES-tdTomato to aid detection of positive cells. This reporter system is effective in a wide range of developmental and cellular contexts. We recorded spontaneous cortical calcium waves in intact awake newborns and evaluated concentration-dependent responses to odorants in the adult olfactory bulb. Moreover, PC::G5-tdT effectively reports intracellular calcium dynamics in somas and fine processesof astrocytes and microglial cells. Through electrophysiological and behavioral analyses, we determined that GCaMP5G expression had no major impact on nervous system performance. PC::G5-tdT will be instrumental for a variety of brain mapping experiments.

@article{Periasamy2007,
	Abstract = {The sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium transport ATPase (SERCA) is a pump that transports calcium ions from the cytoplasm into the SR. It is present in both animal and plant cells, although knowledge of SERCA in the latter is scant. The pump shares the catalytic properties of ion-motive ATPases of the P-type family, but has distinctive regulation properties. The SERCA pump is encoded by a family of three genes, SERCA1, 2, and 3, that are highly conserved but localized on different chromosomes. The SERCA isoform diversity is dramatically enhanced by alternative splicing of the transcripts, occurring mainly at the COOH-terminal. At present, more than 10 different SERCA isoforms have been detected at the protein level. These isoforms exhibit both tissue and developmental specificity, suggesting that they contribute to unique physiological properties of the tissue in which they are expressed. The function of the SERCA pump is modulated by the endogenous molecules phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN), expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The mechanism of action of PLB on SERCA is well characterized, whereas that of SLN is only beginning to be understood. Because the SERCA pump plays a major role in muscle contraction, a number of investigations have focused on understanding its role in cardiac and skeletal muscle disease. These studies document that SERCA pump expression and activity are decreased in aging and in a variety of pathophysiological conditions including heart failure. Recently, SERCA pump gene transfer was shown to be effective in restoring contractile function in failing heart muscle, thus emphasizing its importance in muscle physiology and its potential use as a therapeutic agent.},

@article{Filosa2006,
	Abstract = {The mechanisms by which active neurons, via astrocytes, rapidly signal intracerebral arterioles to dilate remain obscure. Here we show that modest elevation of extracellular potassium (K+) activated inward rectifier K+ (Kir) channels and caused membrane potential hyperpolarization in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of intracerebral arterioles and, in cortical brain slices, induced Kir-dependent vasodilation and suppression of SMC intracellular calcium (Ca2+) oscillations. Neuronal activation induced a rapid ({\textless}2 s latency) vasodilation that was greatly reduced by Kir channel blockade and completely abrogated by concurrent cyclooxygenase inhibition. Astrocytic endfeet exhibited large-conductance, Ca2+-sensitive K+ (BK) channel currents that could be activated by neuronal stimulation. Blocking BK channels or ablating the gene encoding these channels prevented neuronally induced vasodilation and suppression of arteriolar SMC Ca2+, without affecting the astrocytic Ca2+ elevation. These results support the concept of intercellular K+ channel-to-K+ channel signaling, through which neuronal activity in the form of an astrocytic Ca2+ signal is decoded by astrocytic BK channels, which locally release K+ into the perivascular space to activate SMC Kir channels and cause vasodilation.},

	Abstract = {1. In connections formed by nerve terminals of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells onto bitufted interneurones in young (postnatal day (P)14-15) rat somatosensory cortex, the efficacy and reliability of synaptic transmission were low. At these connections release was facilitated by paired-pulse stimulation (at 10 Hz). In connections formed by terminals of layer 2/3 pyramids with multipolar interneurones efficacy and reliability were high and release was depressed by paired-pulse stimulation. In both types of terminal, however, the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels that controlled transmitter release were predominantly of the P/Q- and N-subtypes. 2. The relationship between unitary EPSP amplitude and extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o) was steeper for facilitating than for depressing terminals. Fits to a Hill equation with nH = 4 indicated that the apparent KD of the Ca2+ sensor for vesicle release was two- to threefold lower in depressing terminals than in facilitating ones. 3. Intracellular loading of pyramidal neurones with the fast and slowly acting Ca2+ buffers BAPTA and EGTA differentially reduced transmitter release in these two types of terminal. Unitary EPSPs evoked by pyramidal cell stimulation in bitufted cells were reduced by presynaptic BAPTA and EGTA with half-effective concentrations of approximately 0.1 and approximately 1 mM, respectively. Unitary EPSPs evoked in multipolar cells were reduced to one-half of control at higher concentrations of presynaptic BAPTA and EGTA (approximately 0.5 and approximately 7 mM, respectively). 4. Frequency-dependent facilitation of EPSPs in bitufted cells was abolished by EGTA at concentrations of {\textgreater}or = 0.2 mM, suggesting that accumulation of free Ca2+ is essential for facilitation in the terminals contacting bitufted cells. In contrast, facilitation was unaffected or even slightly increased in the terminals loaded with BAPTA in the concentration range 0.02-0.5 mM. This is attributed to partial saturation of exogenously added BAPTA. However, BAPTA at concentrations {\textgreater}or = 1 mM also abolished facilitation. 5. Frequency-dependent depression of EPSPs in multipolar cells was not significantly reduced by EGTA. With BAPTA, the depression decreased at concentrations {\textgreater}0.5 mM, concomitant with a reduction in amplitude of the first EPSP in a train. 6. An analysis is presented that interprets the effects of EGTA and BAPTA on synaptic efficacy and its short-term modification during paired-pulse stimulation in terms of changes in [Ca2+] at the release site ([Ca2+]RS) and that infers the affinity of the Ca2+ sensor from the dependence of unitary EPSPs on [Ca2+]o. 7. The results suggest that the target cell-specific difference in release from the terminals on bitufted or multipolar cells can be explained by a longer diffusional distance between Ca2+ channels and release sites and/or lower Ca2+ channels density in the terminals that contact bitufted cells. This would lead to a lower [Ca2+] at release sites and would also explain the higher apparent K(D) of the Ca2+ sensor in facilitating terminals.},

@article{Piet2004,
	Abstract = {Interactions between separate synaptic inputs converging on the same target appear to contribute to the fine-tuning of information processing in the central nervous system. Intersynaptic crosstalk is made possible by transmitter spillover from the synaptic cleft and its diffusion over a distance to neighboring synapses. This is the case for glutamate, which inhibits gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission in several brain regions through the activation of presynaptic receptors. Such heterosynaptic modulation depends on factors that influence diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS). Because glial cells represent a physical barrier to diffusion and, in addition, are essential for glutamate uptake, we investigated the physiological contribution of the astrocytic environment of neurons to glutamate-mediated intersynaptic communication in the brain. Here we show that the reduced astrocytic coverage of magnocellular neurons occurring in the supraoptic nucleus of lactating rats facilitates diffusion in the ECS, as revealed by tortuosity and volume fraction measurements. Under these conditions, glutamate spillover, monitored through metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated depression of GABAergic transmission, is greatly enhanced. Conversely, impeding diffusion with dextran largely prevents crosstalk between glutamatergic and GABAergic afferent inputs. Astrocytes, therefore, by hindering diffusion in the ECS, regulate intersynaptic communication between neighboring synapses and, probably, overall volume transmission in the brain.},

@article{Lindauer2010,
	Abstract = {Recently, a universal, simple, and fail-safe mechanism has been proposed by which cerebral blood flow (CBF) might be coupled to oxygen metabolism during neuronal activation without the need for any tissue-based mechanism. According to this concept, vasodilation occurs by local erythrocytic release of nitric oxide or ATP wherever and whenever hemoglobin is deoxygenated, directly matching oxygen demand and supply in every tissue. For neurovascular coupling in the brain, we present experimental evidence challenging this view by applying an experimental regime operating without deoxy-hemoglobin. Hyperbaric hyperoxygenation (HBO) allowed us to prevent hemoglobin deoxygenation, as the oxygen that was physically dissolved in the tissue was sufficient to support oxidative metabolism. Regional CBF and regional cerebral blood oxygenation were measured using a cranial window preparation in anesthetized rats. Hemodynamic and neuronal responses to electrical forepaw stimulation or cortical spreading depression (CSD) were analyzed under normobaric normoxia and during HBO up to 4 ATA (standard atmospheres absolute). Inconsistent with the proposed mechanism, during HBO, CBF responses to functional activation or CSD were unchanged. Our results show that activation-induced CBF regulation in the brain does not operate through the release of vasoactive mediators on hemoglobin deoxygenation or through a tissue-based oxygen-sensing mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Summary: The coupling of electrical activity in the brain to changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) is of interest because hemodynamic changes are used to track brain function. Recent studies, especially those investigating the cerebellar cortex, have shown that the spike rate in the principal target cell of a brain region (i.e. the efferent cell) does not affect vascular response amplitude. Subthreshold integrative synaptic pro- cesses trigger changes in the local microcirculation and local glucose consumption. The spatial specificity of the vascular response on the brain surface is limited because of the func- tional anatomy of the pial vessels. Within the cortex there is a characteristic laminar flow distribution, the largest changes of which are observed at the depth of maximal synaptic activity (i.e. layer IV) for an afferent input system. Under most condi- tions, increases in CBF are explained by activity in postsynap- tic neurons, but presynaptic elements can contribute. Neuro- transmitters do not mediate increases in CBF that are triggered by the concerted action of several second messenger molecules. It is important to distinguish between effective synaptic inhi- bition and deactivation that increase and decrease CBF and glucose consumption, respectively. In summary, hemodynamic changes evoked by neuronal activity depend on the afferent input function (i.e. all aspects of presynaptic and postsynaptic processing), but are totally independent of the efferent function (i.e., the spike rate of the same region). Thus, it is not possible to conclude whether the output level of activity of a region is increased based on brain maps that use blood-flow changes as markers},

	Abstract = {To explore non-synaptic mechanisms in paroxysmal discharges, we used a computer model of a simplified hippocampal pyramidal cell, surrounded by interstitial space and a "glial-endothelial" buffer system. Ion channels for Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl- ion antiport 3Na/Ca, and "active" ion pumps were represented in the neuron membrane. The glia had "leak" conductances and an ion pump. Fluxes, concentration changes and cell swelling were computed. The neuron was stimulated by injecting current. Afterdischarge (AD) followed stimulation if depolarization due to rising interstitial K+ concentration ([K+]o) activated persistent Na+ current (INa.P). AD was either simple or self-regenerating; either regular (tonic) or burst-type (clonic); and always self-limiting. Self-regenerating AD required sufficient INa.P to ensure re-excitation. Burst firing depended on activation of dendritic Ca2+ currents and Ca-dependent K+ current. Varying glial buffer function influenced [K+]o accumulation and afterdischarge duration. Variations in Na+ and K+ currents influenced the threshold and the duration of AD. The data show that high [K+]o and intrinsic membrane currents can produce the feedback of self-regenerating afterdischarges without synaptic input. The simulated discharge resembles neuron behavior during paroxysmal firing in living brain tissue.},

	Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to evaluate the haemodynamic response of the cerebral cortex and thalamus during generalized spike and wave or polyspike and wave (GSW) bursts in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). The haemodynamic response is measured by fMRI [blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect]. We used combined EEG-functional MRI, a method that allows the unambiguous measurement of the BOLD effect during bursts, compared with measurements during the inter-burst interval. Fifteen patients with IGE had GSW bursts during scanning and technically acceptable studies. fMRI cortical changes as a result of GSW activity were present in 14 patients (93{\%}). Changes in the form of activation (increased BOLD) or deactivation (decreased BOLD) occurred symmetrically in the cortex of both hemispheres, involved anterior as much as posterior head regions, but were variable across patients. Bilateral thalamic changes were also found in 12 patients (80{\%}). Activation predominated over deactivation in the thalamus, whereas the opposite was seen in the cerebral cortex. These results bring a new light to the pathophysiolocal mechanisms generating GSW. The spatial distribution of BOLD responses to GSW was unexpected: it involved as many posterior as anterior head regions, contrary to the usual fronto-central predominance seen in EEG. The presence of a thalamic BOLD response in most patients provided, for the first time in a group of human patients, confirmation of the evidence of thalamic involvement seen in animal models. The possible mechanisms underlying these phenomena are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Enhanced neuronal activity in the brain triggers a local increase in blood flow, termed functional hyperemia, via several mechanisms, including calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling in astrocytes. However, recent in vivo studies have questioned the role of astrocytes in functional hyperemia because of the slow and sparse dynamics of their somatic Ca(2+) signals and the absence of glutamate metabotropic receptor 5 in adults. Here, we reexamined their role in neurovascular coupling by selectively expressing a genetically encoded Ca(2+) sensor in astrocytes of the olfactory bulb. We show that in anesthetized mice, the physiological activation of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) terminals reliably triggers Ca(2+) increases in astrocyte processes but not in somata. These Ca(2+) increases systematically precede the onset of functional hyperemia by 1-2 s, reestablishing astrocytes as potential regulators of neurovascular coupling.},

	Abstract = {The spatial-temporal characteristics of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) changes elicited in neurons and astrocytes by various types of stimuli were investigated by means of confocal fluorescent microscopy in acute rat brain slices loaded with the Ca2+ indicator indo-1. Neurons and astrocytes from the visual cortex and CA1 hippocampal region were identified in situ on the basis of their morphological, electrophysiological, and pharmacological features. We show here that stimulation of neuronal afferents triggered periodic [Ca2+]i oscillations in astrocytes. The frequency of these oscillations was under a dynamic control by neuronal activity as it changed according to the pattern of stimulation. After repetitive episodes of neuronal stimulation as well as repetitive stimulation with a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, astrocytes displayed a long-lasting increase in [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency. Oscillating astrocytes were accompanied by repetitive [Ca2+]i elevations in adjacent neurons, most likely because of the release of glutamate via a tetanus toxin-resistant process. These results reveal that [Ca2+]i oscillations in astrocytes represent a highly plastic signaling system that underlies the reciprocal communication between neurons and astrocytes.},

These exciting findings add to the large body of evidence demonstrating that astrocytes play a central role in brain homeostasis, in particular via the numerous cooperative metabolic processes they establish with neurons, such as the supply of energy metabolites and neurotransmitter recycling functions. Furthermore, impairments in astrocytic function are increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to neuronal dysfunction and, in particular, neurodegenerative processes. In this review, we discuss recent evidence supporting important roles for astrocytes in neuropathological conditions such as neuroinflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

	Abstract = {When a short segment of arteriole is stimulated, vasomotor responses spread bidirectionally along the vessel axis purportedly via gap junctions. We used connexin40 knockout (Cx40-/-) mice to study vasomotor responses induced by 10-second trains of electrical stimulation (30 Hz, 1 ms, 30 to 50 V) in 2nd or 3rd order arterioles of the cremaster muscle. Measurements were made at the stimulation site (local) and at conducted sites (500, 1000, and 2000 microm upstream). In wild-type (Cx40+/+) animals, electrical stimulation evoked a local vasoconstriction and a conducted vasodilation that spread very rapidly along the vessel length without detectable decay. In Cx40-/- mice, the conducted dilation was converted into either vasoconstriction or a slowly developing vasodilation that decayed along the vessel length. Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 micromol/L) had no effect on the local vasoconstriction in either Cx40+/+ or Cx40-/- mice, but enhanced the conducted vasodilation in Cx40+/+ animals. In Cx40-/- mice, TTX abolished the conducted vasoconstriction when present and revealed a small vasodilation that decayed with distance. In the group of Cx40-/- mice in which electrical stimulation elicited a conducted vasodilation, TTX had no effect. Immunocytochemistry revealed Cx40 only in the endothelial layer of arterioles from Cx40+/+ mice and complete elimination of this connexin in the Cx40-/- animals. These results indicate that focal current stimulation causes vasoconstriction by a combination of perivascular nerve stimulation and smooth muscle activation. Moreover, electrical stimulation activates a nonneuronal, Cx40-dependent vasodilator response that spreads along the vessel length without decay.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to characterizing evoked hemodynamic responses in fMRI based on nonlinear system identification, in particular the use of Volterra series. The approach employed enables one to estimate Volterra kernels that describe the relationship between stimulus presentation and the hemodynamic responses that ensue. Volterra series are essentially high-order extensions of linear convolution or "smoothing." These kernels, therefore, represent a nonlinear characterization of the hemodynamic response function that can model the responses to stimuli in different contexts (in this work, different rates of word presentation) and interactions among stimuli. The nonlinear components of the responses were shown to be statistically significant, and the kernel estimates were validated using an independent event-related fMRI experiment. One important manifestation of these nonlinear effects is a modulation of stimulus-specific responses by preceding stimuli that are proximate in time. This means that responses at high-stimulus presentation rates saturate and, in some instances, show an inverted U behavior. This behavior appears to be specific to BOLD effects (as distinct from evoked changes in cerebral blood flow) and may represent a hemodynamic "refractoriness." The aim of this paper is to describe the theory and techniques upon which these conclusions were based and to discuss the implications for experimental design and analysis.},

	Abstract = {Human blood cells can be separated using an apparatus described by Hanning and co-workers (Model FF4 Desaga Heidelberg). The method of free flow preparative electrophoresis uses a specific property of blood cells when subjected to an electric field: their electrophoretic mobility. Three regions of migration can be defined: --a high mobility region (HMR); --a low mobility region (LMR) and --an intermediate mobility region (IMR). After the electrophoretic migration, the various cell fractions are identified. If human leucocytes are subjected to an electric field (40 volts/cm) it is possible to isolate several populations which differ by their membranes electric charge. The repartition of the neutrophiles granulocytes is twofold: --one fraction of high mobility (HMR) and --one fraction of low mobility (LMR). The meaning of these two populations is being discussed. Between these teo fractions is located the lymphocyte fraction which is represented by a single peak of intermediate mobility (IMR). Eosinophiles and monocytes are concentrated in low mobility fraction (LMR). With appropriate migration parameters (80 volts/cm, various component buffers) it is possible to obtain from lymphocytes, purified by density gradient, an electrophoretic separation of T and B lymphocytes population. Histograms obtained from quantitative measures (on collected cell fractions) show an unimodal distribution. When separated cells are characterized by three membranes markers (E. Rosettes, EAC Rosettes and surface immunoglobulins) the electrophoretic heterogeneity of B and T cells is then demonstrated. With E Rosettes (T cells) the majority of T lymphocytes is distributed in HMR and IMR. With EAC Rosettes and membrane immunofluorescence (B cells markers) the majority of B lymphocytes is found in the LMR. Thus an important enrichment of T and B sub-population is obtained, but contamination from one another still remains too important. More selective methods should lead to an improvement of this cell separation.},

	Abstract = {The brain's energy supply determines its information processing power, and generates functional imaging signals. The energy use on the different subcellular processes underlying neural information processing has been estimated previously for the grey matter of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. However, these estimates need reevaluating following recent work demonstrating that action potentials in mammalian neurons are much more energy efficient than was previously thought. Using this new knowledge, this paper provides revised estimates for the energy expenditure on neural computation in a simple model for the cerebral cortex and a detailed model of the cerebellar cortex. In cerebral cortex, most signaling energy (50{\%}) is used on postsynaptic glutamate receptors, 21{\%} is used on action potentials, 20{\%} on resting potentials, 5{\%} on presynaptic transmitter release, and 4{\%} on transmitter recycling. In the cerebellar cortex, excitatory neurons use 75{\%} and inhibitory neurons 25{\%} of the signaling energy, and most energy is used on information processing by non-principal neurons: Purkinje cells use only 15{\%} of the signaling energy. The majority of cerebellar signaling energy use is on the maintenance of resting potentials (54{\%}) and postsynaptic receptors (22{\%}), while action potentials account for only 17{\%} of the signaling energy use.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes are critical regulators of neural and neurovascular network communication. Potassium transport is a central mechanism behind their many functions. Astrocytes encircle synapses with their distal processes, which express two potassium pumps (Na-K and NKCC) and an inward rectifying potassium channel (Kir), whereas the vessel-adjacent endfeet express Kir and BK potassium channels. We provide a detailed model of potassium flow throughout the neurovascular unit (synaptic region, astrocytes, and arteriole) for the cortex of the young brain. Our model reproduces several phenomena observed experimentally: functional hyperemia, in which neural activity triggers astrocytic potassium release at the perivascular endfoot, inducing arteriole dilation; K+ undershoot in the synaptic space after periods of neural activity; neurally induced astrocyte hyperpolarization during Kir blockade. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the vascular response during functional hyperemia are governed by astrocytic Kir for the fast onset and astrocytic BK for maintaining dilation. The model supports the hypothesis that K+ undershoot is caused by excessive astrocytic uptake through Na-K and NKCC pumps, whereas the effect is balanced by Kir. We address parametric uncertainty using high-dimensional stochastic sensitivity analysis and identify possible model limitations. ?? 2013 Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) is an intracellular Ca(2+) pump localized on the SR/ER membrane. The role of SERCA in refilling intracellular Ca(2+) stores is pivotal for maintaining intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, and disturbed SERCA activity causes many disease phenotypes, including heart failure, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. Although SERCA activity has been described using a simple enzyme activity equation, the dynamics of SERCA activity in living cells is still unknown. To monitor SERCA activity in living cells, we constructed an enhanced CFP (ECFP)- and FlAsH-tagged SERCA2a, designated F-L577, which retains the ATP-dependent Ca(2+) pump activity. The FRET efficiency between ECFP and FlAsH of F-L577 is dependent on the conformational state of the molecule. ER luminal Ca(2+) imaging confirmed that the FRET signal changes directly reflect the Ca(2+) pump activity. Dual imaging of cytosolic Ca(2+) and the FRET signals of F-L577 in intact COS7 cells revealed that SERCA2a activity is coincident with the oscillatory cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration changes evoked by ATP stimulation. The Ca(2+) pump activity of SERCA2a in intact cells can be expressed by the Hill equation with an apparent affinity for Ca(2+) of 0.41 $\pm$ 0.0095 {\$}\mu{\$}m and a Hill coefficient of 5.7 $\pm$ 0.73. These results indicate that in the cellular environment the Ca(2+) dependence of ATPase activation is highly cooperative and that SERCA2a acts as a rapid switch to refill Ca(2+) stores in living cells for shaping the intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics. F-L577 will be useful for future studies on Ca(2+) signaling involving SERCA2a activity.},

	Abstract = {The effect of direct cortical electrical stimulation on the pattern of erythrocyte perfusion in the capillary network of the rat cerebral cortex was studied by fluorescence intravital video-microscopy. The movement of fluorescently labeled red blood cells (FRBCs) in individual capillaries 50-70 {\$}\mu{\$}m subsurface in the dorsal somatosensory cortex was visualized using a closed cranial window. Cortical stimulation electrodes were placed on opposite sides of the window. FRBC velocity (mm/s) and supply rate (cells/s) were measured in 51 capillaries from six rats before and during electrical stimulation of increasing intensities (15-s trains of 3-Hz, 3-ms, 0.5-5.0-mA, square pulses). FRBC velocity, supply rate, and the instantaneous capillary erythrocyte content (lineal cell density, LCD, cells/mm) increased with the stimulation current and reached maxima of 110, 160 and 33{\%} above control, respectively. Capillaries with low resting velocity showed a greater response than those with high resting velocity. The fraction of capillaries in which FRBC velocity increased was not constant, but increased with the stimulation current, as did the magnitude of the velocity change in these capillaries. A few capillaries showed a negative FRBC velocity response at stimulations {\textless}4 mA. These results suggest that a robust rise in the fraction of responding (engaged) capillaries and a smaller rise in the capillary LCD contribute to neuronal activation-induced cortical hyperemia. Thus, capillary engagement and erythrocyte recruitment appear to represent important components of the cortical functional hyperemic response. These results provide insight into some of the specific hemodynamic changes associated with functional hyperemia occurring at the capillary level. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {This study shows how sensitivity analysis and subset selection can be employed in a cardiovascular model to estimate total systemic resistance, cerebrovascular resistance, arterial compliance, and time for peak systolic ventricular pressure for healthy young and elderly subjects. These quantities are parameters in a simple lumped parameter model that predicts pressure and flow in the systemic circulation. The model is combined with experimental measurements of blood flow velocity from the middle cerebral artery and arterial finger blood pressure. To estimate the model parameters we use nonlinear optimization combined with sensitivity analysis and subset selection. Sensitivity analysis allows us to rank model parameters from the most to the least sensitive with respect to the output states (cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial blood pressure). Subset selection allows us to identify a set of independent candidate parameters that can be estimated given limited data. Analyses of output from both methods allow us to identify five independent sensitive parameters that can be estimated given the data. Results show that with the advance of age total systemic and cerebral resistances increase, that time for peak systolic ventricular pressure is increases, and that arterial compliance is reduced. Thus, the method discussed in this study provides a new methodology to extract clinical markers that cannot easily be assessed noninvasively.},

	Abstract = {The present work evaluated the reproducibility and variance of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to natural whisker stimulation in the barrel cortex of awake behaving mice. The animal was placed on an air float ball that allowed the animal to walk, while the head of the animal was fixed in a custom-made stereotactic apparatus. Dynamic CBF changes in the barrel cortex and animal locomotion were simultaneously monitored with laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and an optical motion sensor that detected the rotation distance of the ball, respectively. Whisker stimulation-induced CBF measured under daytime and nighttime conditions showed consistent responses (24{\%} and 23{\%} of the pre-stimulus baseline, respectively), whereas the amount of locomotion was 1.4 times higher during nighttime relative to daytime. Repeated longitudinal experiments over 7 days showed a reproducible, evoked CBF (13-26{\%} relative to the baseline among 7 animals). The mean of the variance coefficient (i.e., standard deviation divided by mean) across multiple days was 0.11 and 0.75 for evoked CBF and locomotion, respectively. These results showed reproducible and reliable measurements of longitudinal CBF response in behaving mice regardless of day-to-day variations in locomotion. Furthermore, we confirmed that the CBF response to whisker stimulation was well localized and reproducible, measured with laser speckle imaging under awake condition. The results further show the capability of long-term hemodynamic imaging in normal and disease-model mice, which is of particular importance for understanding the longitudinal changes and plasticity of neurovascular coupling and behavioral performances such as during growth, development and aging. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Calcium ions play crucial roles in a large variety of cell functions. The recent proposal that changes in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in astrocytes underline a reciprocal communication system between neurons and astrocytes encourages the interest in the definition of the various components participating in this novel Ca2+ signaling system. We investigate here whether functional voltage-operated calcium channels (Ca2+ VOCs), which are clearly expressed in cultured astrocytes, participate in the regulation of [Ca2+]i also in astrocytes in situ. Depolarization with 40-60 mM K+ was used to analyze the activity of Ca2+ VOCs in Indo-1-loaded astrocytes in acute slices from the visual cortex and the CA1 hippocampal region of developing rats. We demonstrate here that the depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i increases in astrocytes are solely attributed to the activation of metabotropic receptors by neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, released by synaptic terminals on depolarization. In fact, (1) the K+-induced [Ca2+]i increases in astrocyte [Ca2+]i were potently reduced by alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine, a metabotropic glutamate receptor competitive inhibitor; (2) after emptying intracellular Ca2+ stores with cyclopiazonic acid, none of the astrocytes displayed a [Ca2+]i increase on the depolarizing stimulus; and (3) after inhibiting neurotransmitter secretion in neurons by incubating the slices with tetanus neurotoxin, no [Ca2+]i increase on K+ stimulation was observed in astrocytes. Finally, patch-clamp whole-cell recordings from hippocampal astrocytes in acute brain slices failed to reveal any voltage-dependent calcium currents. On the basis of these results, the various roles proposed for astrocyte Ca2+ VOCs in the CNS should be reconsidered.},

	Abstract = {Moment-to-moment changes in local neuronal activity lead to dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow. Emerging evidence implicates astrocytes as one of the key players in coordinating this neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are poised to sense glutamatergic synaptic activity over a large spatial domain via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and subsequent calcium signaling and via energy-dependent glutamate transport. Astrocyte foot processes can signal vascular smooth muscle by arachidonic acid pathways involving astrocytic cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, astrocytic cyclooxygenase-1 and smooth muscle cytochrome P450 ??-hydroxylase activities, and by astrocytic and smooth muscle potassium channels. Non-glutamatergic transmitters released from neurons, such as nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites and vasoactive intestinal peptide, might modulate neurovascular signaling at the level of the astrocyte or smooth muscle. Thus, astrocytes have a pivotal role in dynamic signaling within the neurovascular unit. Important questions remain on how this signaling is integrated with other pathways in health and disease. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The neurovascular unit is a coordinated and interactional system of neurons, astrocytes, and microvessels in the brain. A central autoregulation mechanism observed in this unit is functional hyperemia, in which the microvasculature dilates in response to local neural activity in order to meet the increased demand for blood flow and oxygen. We have developed the first interactional model of bidirectional signaling in the neurovascular unit. The vascular model includes a description of vasomotion, the vascular oscillatory response to transmural pressure, observed in vivo. The communication mechanisms in the model include neural synaptic glutamate and potassium signaling to the astrocytes, potassium signaling from the astrocyte to the microvasculature, and astrocytic mechanosensation of vascular changes. The model response of the astrocyte to arteriolar dilation is validated with recent in vivo and in vitro experimental results. The model reproduces for the first time the in vitro observed phenomenon in which arteriole radius and Ca(2+) oscillations, "vasomotion," are damped due to neural induced astrocytic signaling.},

The exponentially increasing volume and complexity of modern data sets promises to transform the scientific practice, but also poses a number of common technological challenges. The Virtual Observatory concept is the astronomical community's response to these challenges: it aims to harness the progress in information technology in the service of astronomy, and at the same time provide a valuable testbed for information technology and applied computer science. Challenges broadly fall into two categories: data handling (or "data farming"), including issues such as archives, intelligent storage, databases, interoperability, fast networks, etc., and data mining, data understanding, and knowledge discovery, which include issues such as automated clustering and classification, multivariate correlation searches, pattern recognition, visualization in highly hyperdimensional parameter spaces, etc., as well as various applications of machine learning in these contexts. Such techniques are forming a methodological foundation for science with massive and complex data sets in general, and are likely to have a much broather impact on the modern society, commerce, information economy, security, etc. There is a powerful emerging synergy between the computationally enabled science and the science-driven computing, which will drive the progress in science, scholarship, and many other venues in the 21st century.},

	Abstract = {The spatiotemporal evolution of cerebral microcirculatory adjustments to functional brain stimulation is the fundamental determinant of the functional specificity of hemodynamically weighted neuroimaging signals. Very little data, however, exist on the functional reactivity of capillaries, the vessels most proximal to the activated neuronal population. Here, we used two-photon laser scanning microscopy, in combination with intracranial electrophysiology and intravital video microscopy, to explore the changes in cortical hemodynamics, at the level of individual capillaries, in response to steady-state forepaw stimulation in an anesthetized rodent model. Overall, the microcirculatory response to functional stimulation was characterized by a pronounced decrease in vascular transit times (20{\%}+/-8{\%}), a dilatation of the capillary bed (10.9{\%}+/-1.2{\%}), and significant increases in red blood cell speed (33.0{\%}+/-7.7{\%}) and flux (19.5{\%}+/-6.2{\%}). Capillaries dilated more than the medium-caliber vessels, indicating a decreased heterogeneity in vessel volumes and increased blood flow-carrying capacity during neuronal activation relative to baseline. Capillary dilatation accounted for an estimated approximately 18{\%} of the total change in the focal cerebral blood volume. In support of a capacity for focal redistribution of microvascular flow and volume, significant, though less frequent, local stimulation-induced decreases in capillary volume and erythrocyte speed and flux also occurred. The present findings provide further evidence of a strong functional reactivity of cerebral capillaries and underscore the importance of changes in the capillary geometry in the hemodynamic response to neuronal activation.},

@article{Richardson2005,
	Abstract = {The synaptic drive from neuronal populations varies considerably over short time scales. Such changes in the pre-synaptic rate trigger many temporal processes absent under steady-state conditions. This paper examines the differential impact of pyramidal cell population bursts on post-synaptic pyramidal cells receiving depressing synapses, and on a class of interneuron that receives facilitating synapses. In experiment a significant shift of the order of one hundred milliseconds is seen between the response of these two cell classes to the same population burst. It is demonstrated here that such a temporal differentiation of the response can be explained by the synaptic and membrane properties without recourse to elaborate cortical wiring schemes. Experimental data is first used to construct models of the two types of dynamic synaptic response. A population-based approach is then followed to examine analytically the temporal synaptic filtering effects of the population burst for the two post-synaptic targets. The peak-to-peak delays seen in experiment can be captured by the model for experimentally realistic parameter ranges. It is further shown that the temporal separation of the response is communicated in the outgoing action potentials of the two post-synaptic cells: pyramidal cells fire at the beginning of the burst and the class of interneuron receiving facilitating synapses fires at the end of the burst. The functional role of such delays in the temporal organisation of activity in the cortical microcircuit is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ oscillations are part of the intra- and intercellular signalling in many cell types. We have studied Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes in acute brain slices of the hippocampus of juvenile rats (postnatal 8-14 days old), using confocal laser scanning microscopy and bulk-loading of the Ca2+ -sensitive dye Fluo-4. Astrocytes were identified morphologically in the stratum radiatum, and by their Ca2+ response in the absence of external K+. Thirty-five per cent of astrocytes (43 slices) showed spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations, with a frequency of 1.26 +/- 0.11 transients/min (n = 366). These Ca2+ signals were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM) and Ni2+ (2 mM), but were sensitive to interference with the phospholipase C-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were reduced or suppressed by antagonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) of groups I and II, but not affected by antagonists of group III. Glutamate (1-100 microM) and specific agonists of mGluR groups I and II evoked concentration-dependent Ca2+ signals, which were oscillatory at intermediate concentrations (e.g. at 10 microM glutamate). Our results indicate that mGluRs of both groups I and II are involved in mediating Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes, which might be glial responses to micromolar changes of glutamate in the extracellular spaces.},

	Abstract = {Mammalian nitric oxide synthase (NOS), a flavo-hemoprotein, tightly regulates nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and thereby its dual biological activities as a key signaling molecule for vasodilatation and neurotransmission at low concentrations, and also as a defensive cytotoxin at higher concentrations. Three NOS isoforms, iNOS, eNOS and nNOS (inducible, endothelial, and neuronal NOS) achieve their key biological functions by tight regulation of interdomain electron transfer (IET) process via interdomain interactions. In particular, the FMN-heme IET is essential in coupling electron transfer in the reductase domain with NO synthesis in the heme domain by delivery of electrons required for O 2 activation at the catalytic heme site. Compelling evidence indicates that calmodulin (CaM) activates NO synthesis in eNOS and nNOS through a conformational change of the domain from its shielded electron-accepting (input) state to a new electron-donating (output) state, and that CaM is also required for proper alignment of the domains in all the three NOS isoforms. Another exciting recent development in NOS enzymology is the discovery of importance of the FMN domain motions in modulating reactivity and structure of the catalytic heme active site (in addition to the primary role of controlling the IET processes). In the absence of a structure of full-length NOS, an integrated approach of spectroscopic (e.g. pulsed EPR, MCD, resonance Raman), rapid kinetics (laser flash photolysis and stopped flow) and mutagenesis methods is critical to unravel the molecular details of the interdomain FMN/heme interactions. This is to investigate the roles of dynamic conformational changes of the FMN domain and the docking between the primary functional FMN and heme domains in regulating NOS activity. The recent developments in understanding of mechanisms of the NOS regulation that are driven by the combined approach are the focuses of this review. An improved understanding of the role of interdomain FMN/heme interaction and CaM binding may serve as the basis for the design of new selective inhibitors of NOS isoforms. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Red blood cells (RBCs) have highly deformable viscoelastic membranes exhibiting complex rheological response and rich hydrodynamic behavior governed by special elastic and bending properties and by the external/internal fluid and membrane viscosities. We present a multiscale RBC model that is able to predict RBC mechanics, rheology, and dynamics in agreement with experiments. Based on an analytic theory, the modeled membrane properties can be uniquely related to the experimentally established RBC macroscopic properties without any adjustment of parameters. The RBC linear and nonlinear elastic deformations match those obtained in optical-tweezers experiments. The rheological properties of the membrane are compared with those obtained in optical magnetic twisting cytometry, membrane thermal fluctuations, and creep followed by cell recovery. The dynamics of RBCs in shear and Poiseuille flows is tested against experiments and theoretical predictions, and the applicability of the latter is discussed. Our findings clearly indicate that a purely elastic model for the membrane cannot accurately represent the RBC's rheological properties and its dynamics, and therefore accurate modeling of a viscoelastic membrane is necessary.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes, the most prominent glial cell type in the brain, send specialized processes named endfeet, which enwrap blood vessels and express a large molecular repertoire dedicated to the physiology of the vascular system. One of the most striking properties of astrocyte endfeet is their enrichment in gap junction protein connexins 43 and 30 (Cx43 and Cx30) allowing for direct intercellular trafficking of ions and small signaling molecules through perivascular astroglial networks. The contribution of astroglial connexins to the physiology of the brain vascular system has never been addressed. Here, we show that Cx43 and Cx30 expression at the level of perivascular endfeet starts from postnatal days 2 and 12 and is fully mature at postnatal days 15 and 20, respectively, indicating that astroglial perivascular connectivity occurs and develops during postnatal blood?brain barrier (BBB) maturation. We demonstrate that mice lacking Cx30 and Cx43 in GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)-positive cells display astrocyte endfeet edema and a partial loss of the astroglial water channel aquaporin-4 and ?-dystroglycan, a transmembrane receptor anchoring astrocyte endfeet to the perivascular basal lamina. Furthermore, the absence of astroglial connexins weakens the BBB, which opens upon increased hydrostatic vascular pressure and shear stress. These results demonstrate that astroglial connexins are necessary to maintain BBB integrity.},

@article{Figueroa2008,
	Abstract = {Conduction of changes in diameter plays an important role in the coordination of peripheral vascular resistance and, thereby, in the control of arterial blood pressure. It is thought that conduction of vasomotor signals relies on the electrotonic spread of changes in membrane potential from a site of stimulation through gap junctions connecting the cells of the vessel wall. To explore this idea, we stimulated a short segment of mouse cremasteric arterioles with an application, via micropipette, of ACh, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, or pinacidil, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener. Vasodilations were evaluated at the stimulation site (local) and at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 microm upstream. The vasodilator response evoked by direct arteriolar hyperpolarization induced by pinacidil decayed rapidly with distance, as expected for the passive spread of an electrical signal. Deletion of the gap junction proteins connexin37 or connexin40 did not alter the conduction of pinacidil-induced vasodilation. In contrast to pinacidil, the vasodilator response activated by ACh spread along the entire vessel without decrement. Although the ACh-induced conducted vasodilation was similar in wild-type and connexin37 knockout mice, deletion of connexin40 converted the nondecremental conducted response activated by ACh into one similar to that of pinacidil, with a decline in magnitude along the vessel length. These results suggest that ACh activates a mechanism of regenerative conduction of vasodilator responses. Connexin40 is essential for the ACh-activated regenerative vasodilator mechanism. However, neither connexin40 nor connexin37 is indispensable for the electrotonic spread of hyperpolarizing signals.},

	Abstract = {It is not clear whether Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is primarily a neurodegenerative disorder or not. A body of evidence suggests that vascular disorder in brains of individuals with AD contributes to the extremes of this disease. This raises a question whether Alzheimer's dementia is secondary to vascular dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS) and, therefore, the neurodegeneration that follows is a consequence of inadequate cerebral blood flow, altered brain metabolism and failure in physiological functions of brain endothelium which represents a site at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this paper the evidence for a primary role of the CNS vascular system in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia is reviewed to show how alterations in transport across the BBB contribute to development of cerebral ??-amyloidosis in AD. In addition, vascularly-based therapeutic strategies to limit the development of ??-amyloidosis and to remove amyloid and plaques from the CNS of AD individuals are discussed. ??

@article{Hawkins2005,
	Abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the reg- ulated interface between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Although originally observed by Paul Ehrlich in 1885, the nature of the BBB was debated well into the 20th century. The anatomical substrate of the BBB is the cerebral microvascular en- dothelium, which, together with astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and the extracellular matrix, constitute a ``neu- rovascular unit'' that is essential for the health and func- tion of the CNS. Tight junctions (TJ) between endothe- lial cells of the BBB restrict paracellular diffusion of water-soluble substances from blood to brain. The TJ is an intricate complex of transmembrane (junctional ad- hesion molecule-1, occludin, and claudins) and cytoplas- mic (zonula occludens-1 and -2, cingulin, AF-6, and 7H6) proteins linked to the actin cytoskeleton.Theexpression and subcellular localization of TJ proteins are modu- lated by several intrinsic signaling pathways, including those involving calcium, phosphorylation, and G-pro- teins. Disruption ofBBBTJ by disease or drugs can lead to impaired BBB function and thus compromise the CNS. Therefore, understanding how BBB TJ might be affected by various factors holds significant promise for the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases.},

We consistently observe that rat astroglial cells in suspension produce marked relaxation when added to precontracted rings of intact (but not endothelium-denuded) rabbit basilar artery. The ultimate mediator of this relaxation was endothelium-derived nitric oxide whose synthesis is activated by an as yet unidentified factor(s) produced tonically by astrocytes. The factor is relatively stable, and is not arachidonate, or a product of cyclooxygenase or P450 metabolism. Based upon studies with selective inhibitors, the factor appears to result from 12- or 15-lipoxygenase metabolism, the products of which are known to be vasoactive. In a separate series of experiments, astrocyte-conditioned medium stimulated the production of citrulline from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase in bovine aortic endothelial cells. The possible significance for central nervous system (CNS) pathophysiology of an astrocyte-derived vasodilator is discussed.},

We aim at providing the pros and cons to the following statements that, depending on the nature of the afferent input to the neocortex, (i) different neuronal or astroglial messengers, likely acting in sequence, mediate the hemodynamic changes, (ii) some recruited neurons release messengers that directly alter blood vessel tone, (iii) others act by modulating neuronal and astroglial activity, and (iv) astrocytes act as intermediaries for both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. We will stress that a given afferent signal activates a precise neuronal circuitry that determines the mediators of the hemodynamic response as well as the level of interaction with surrounding astrocytes.},

@article{Cui1997,
	Abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit. Aspects of the mslo data not well fitted by the simplified scheme will likely be better accounted for by this more general scheme. The kinetic schemes discussed in this paper may be useful in interpreting the effects of BK channel modifications or mutations.},

	Abstract = {To understand and predict the blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal, an accurate knowledge of the relationship between cerebral blood flow (DeltaCBF) and volume (DeltaCBV) changes is critical. Currently, this relationship is widely assumed to be characterized by Grubb's power-law, derived from primate data, where the power coefficient (alpha) was found to be 0.38. The validity of this general formulation has been examined previously, and an alpha of 0.38 has been frequently cited when calculating the cerebral oxygen metabolism change (DeltaCMRo(2)) using calibrated BOLD. However, the direct use of this relationship has been the subject of some debate, since it is well established that the BOLD signal is primarily modulated by changes in 'venous' CBV (DeltaCBV(v), comprising deoxygenated blood in the capillary, venular, and to a lesser extent, in the arteriolar compartments) instead of total CBV, and yet DeltaCBV(v) measurements in humans have been extremely scarce. In this work, we demonstrate reproducible DeltaCBV(v) measurements at 3 T using venous refocusing for the volume estimation (VERVE) technique, and report on steady-state DeltaCBV(v) and DeltaCBF measurements in human subjects undergoing graded visual and sensorimotor stimulation. We found that: (1) a BOLD-specific flow-volume power-law relationship is described by alpha = 0.23 +/- 0.05, significantly lower than Grubb's constant of 0.38 for total CBV; (2) this power-law constant was not found to vary significantly between the visual and sensorimotor areas; and (3) the use of Grubb's value of 0.38 in gradient-echo BOLD modeling results in an underestimation of DeltaCMRo(2).},

Blood vessels in the brain are equipped with control mechanisms that match oxygen and glucose delivery through blood flow with the local metabolic demands that are imposed by neural activity. However, the cellular bases of this mechanism have remained elusive. A major advance has been the demonstration that astrocytes, cells with extensive contacts with both synapses and cerebral blood vessels, participate in the increases in flow evoked by synaptic activity. Their organization in nonoverlapping spatial domains indicates that they are uniquely positioned to shape the spatial distribution of the vascular responses that are evoked by neural activity. Astrocytic calcium is an important determinant of microvascular function and may regulate flow independently of synaptic activity.

	Abstract = {Moore CI, Cao R. The hemo-neural hypothesis: on the role of blood flow in information processing. J Neurophysiol 99: 2035--2047, 2008. First published October 3, 2007; doi:10.1152/jn.01366.2006. Brain vasculature is a complex and interconnected network under tight regulatory control that exists in intimate communication with neurons and glia. Typically, hemodynamics are considered to exclusively serve as a metabolic support system. In contrast to this canonical view, we propose that hemodynamics also play a role in information processing through modulation of neural activity. Functional hyper-emia, the basis of the functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD signal, is a localized influx of blood correlated with neural activity levels. Func-tional hyperemia is considered by many to be excessive from a metabolic standpoint, but may be appropriate if interpreted as having an activity-dependent neuro-modulatory function. Hemodynamics may impact neural activity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct mechanisms include delivery of diffusible blood-borne mes-sengers and mechanical and thermal modulation of neural activity. Indirect mechanisms are proposed to act through hemodynamic mod-ulation of astrocytes, which can in turn regulate neural activity. These hemo-neural mechanisms should alter the information processing capacity of active local neural networks. Here, we focus on analysis of neocortical sensory processing. We predict that hemodynamics alter the gain of local cortical circuits, modulating the detection and discrimination of sensory stimuli. This novel view of information processing---that includes hemodynamics as an active and significant participant--- has implications for understanding neural representation and the construction of accurate brain models. There are also potential medical benefits of an improved understanding of the role of hemo-dynamics in neural processing, as it directly bears on interpretation of and potential treatment for stroke, dementia, and epilepsy. I N T R O D U C T I O N The brain contains a remarkably rich and interdependent network of neurons, whose activity is well correlated with information processing. The study of this network has been the focus of modern neuroscience (Cajal 1996). The brain also contains a rich and interdependent vascular network, whose " activity " --- blood flow---is typically well correlated with neu-ral activity. Based primarily on knowledge of anatomy, Aris-totle believed that the vasculature was the biological system that manifested its activity in intelligence, emotion, and action (Gross 1998). In contrast, the standard modern view of blood flow is that it serves a physiological function unrelated to information processing, such as bringing oxygen to active neurons, eliminating " waste " generated by neural activity, or regulating temperature. Except in extreme cases of cell damage or death, current hypotheses do not include blood flow as a contributor to shaping neural activity. Realistic computational models of brain function do not include blood flow as a component, and neurophysiologists do not consider it as a regressor to explain variance in their data. In contrast to this canonical position, we propose the hy-pothesis that hemodynamics play a role in information pro-cessing, through modulation of neural activity by blood flow. We predict that functional hyperemia, the " overflow " of blood to a brain region during neural activity, provides a spatially and temporally correlated source of regulation, modulating the excitability of the local circuit. This shaping of the neural response will, in turn, impact representation. The goal of this paper is to describe this alternative view of information processing and to argue for the importance of incorporating this potential class of mechanism into our un-derstanding of how different systems in the brain act in a synthetic manner. We focus our comments on the role that hemodynamics may play in sensory neocortex, because this brain region is widely studied with regard to its information processing role, and a great deal is known about its hemody-namic regulation. This focus is not meant to detract from the potential importance of hemo-neural interactions for processing in other brain areas, or in other contexts, as noted throughout.},

	Abstract = {Studies over the last decade provided evidence that in a dynamic interaction with neurons glial cell astrocytes contribut to fundamental phenomena in the brain. Most of the knowledge on this derives, however, from studies monitoring the astrocyte Ca(2+) response to glutamate. Whether astrocytes can similarly respond to other neurotransmitters, including the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, is relatively unexplored. By using confocal and two photon laser-scanning microscopy the astrocyte response to GABA in the mouse somatosensory and temporal cortex was studied. In slices from developing (P15-20) and adult (P30-60) mice, it was found that in a subpopulation of astrocytes GABA evoked somatic Ca(2+) oscillations. This response was mediated by GABAB receptors and involved both Gi/o protein and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3 ) signalling pathways. In vivo experiments from young adult mice, revealed that also cortical astrocytes in the living brain exibit GABAB receptor-mediated Ca(2+) elevations. At all astrocytic processes tested, local GABA or Baclofen brief applications induced long-lasting Ca(2+) oscillations, suggesting that all astrocytes have the potential to respond to GABA. Finally, in patch-clamp recordings it was found that Ca(2+) oscillations induced by Baclofen evoked astrocytic glutamate release and slow inward currents (SICs) in pyramidal cells from wild type but not IP3 R2(-/-) mice, in which astrocytic GABAB receptor-mediated Ca(2+) elevations are impaired. These data suggest that cortical astrocytes in the mouse brain can sense the activity of GABAergic interneurons and through their specific recruitment contribut to the distinct role played on the cortical network by the different subsets of GABAergic interneurons.

	Abstract = {We developed a mass transport model for a parallel-plate flow chamber apparatus to predict the concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP) produced by cultured endothelial cells (ECs) and investigated how the net rates of production, degradation, and mass transport for these three chemical species vary with changes in wall shear stress ($\tau$w). These simulations provide an improved understanding of experimental results obtained with parallel-plate flow chambers and allows quantitative analysis of the relationship between $\tau$w, adenine nucleotide concentrations, and NO produced by ECs. Experimental data obtained after altering ATP and ADP concentrations with apyrase were analyzed to quantify changes in the rate of NO production (RNO). The effects of different isoforms of apyrase on ATP and ADP concentrations and nucleotide-dependent changes in RNO could be predicted with the model. A decrease in ATP was predicted with apyrase, but an increase in ADP was simulated due to degradation of ATP. We found that a simple proportional relationship relating a component of RNO to the sum of ATP and ADP provided a close match to the fitted curve for experimentally measured changes in RNO with apyrase. Estimates for the proportionality constant ranged from 0.0067 to 0.0321 $\mu$M/s increase in RNO per nM nucleotide concentration, depending on which isoform of apyrase was modeled, with the largest effect of nucleotides on RNO at low $\tau$w ({\textless}6 dyn/cm2).},

	Abstract = {Despite recent advances in alternative brain imaging technologies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains the workhorse for both medical diagnosis and primary research. Indeed, the number of research articles that utilise fMRI have continued to rise unabated since its conception in 1991, despite the limitation that recorded signals originate from the cerebral vasculature rather than neural tissue. Consequently, understanding the relationship between brain activity and the resultant changes in metabolism and blood flow (neurovascular coupling) remains a vital area of research. In the past, technical constraints have restricted investigations of neurovascular coupling to cortical sites and have led to the assumption that coupling in non-cortical structures is the same as in the cortex, despite the lack of any evidence. The current study investigated neurovascular coupling in the rat using whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and multi-channel electrophysiological recordings and measured the response to a sensory stimulus as it proceeded through brainstem, thalamic and cortical processing sites - the so-called whisker-to-barrel pathway. We found marked regional differences in the amplitude of BOLD activation in the pathway and non-linear neurovascular coupling relationships in non-cortical sites. The findings have important implications for studies that use functional brain imaging to investigate sub-cortical function and caution against the use of simple, linear mapping of imaging signals onto neural activity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Amyloidopathic disorders such as Alzheimers disease present symptomology years after the entrenchment of amyloidogenic imbalance. The pathologic (alpha)-helix -{\textgreater} (beta)-strand conversion of amyloid (beta)1-42 and amyloid (beta)1-40 peptides causes neuronal death in the vicinity. Symptomology often presents only after significant neurodegeneration. This thus warrants early detection of amyloidopathy in Alzheimers disease. Nonexistent modalities for direct identification and quantitation of soluble amyloid aggregates or (proto)fibrils forced us to undertake the development of a spectrophotometric technique to support ongoing drug design. Key requirements were independence from the need for extraneous staining, unambiguous amyloid aggregate detection, and minimal influence of interpretative errors. A Cytoviva instrument pivotal to this study captures scattering of light of visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1000 nm) wavelengths within each pixel of the microscopic view field. We thus assembled a scattering intensity pattern database that provided "signatures" of amyloid aggregates. Comparison of unknown samples against this database enabled direct detection of amyloid aggregates. The technique was found useful for monitoring retinal and brain amyloidopathy in an ongoing preclinical anti-AD study, attesting to the techniques sensitivity and specificity. Interestingly, the technique was found applicable not just to excised brain tissue but also to isolated mouse retina. With the retina being heralded widely as a (diagnostic) extension of the CNS and retinal amyloidopathy occurring well before that in the brain, this development raises a possibility for the first direct retinal imaging diagnosis of early asymptomatic Alzheimers disease.},

	Abstract = {Optical imaging slit spectroscopy is a powerful method for estimating quantitative changes in cerebral haemodynamics, such as deoxyhaemoglobin, oxyhaemoglobin and blood volume (Hbr, HbO2 and Hbt, respectively). Its disadvantage is that there is a large loss of spatial data as one image dimension is used to encode spectral wavelength information. Single wavelength optical imaging, on the other hand, produces high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of brain activity, but yields only indirect measures of Hbr, HbO2 and Hbt. In this study we perform two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) in rat barrel cortex during contralateral whisker stimulation to obtain two-dimensional maps over time of Hbr, HbO2 and Hbt. The 2D-OIS was performed by illuminating the cortex with four wavelengths of light (575, 559, 495 and 587 nm), which were presented sequentially at a high frame rate (32 Hz). The contralateral whisker pad was stimulated using two different durations: 1 and 16 s (5 Hz, 1.2 mA). Control experiments used a hypercapnic (5{\%} CO2) challenge to manipulate baseline blood flow and volume in the absence of corresponding neural activation. The 2D-OIS method allowed separation of artery, vein and parenchyma regions. The magnitude of the haemodynamic response elicited varied considerably between different vascular compartments; the largest responses in Hbt were in the arteries and the smallest in the veins. Phase lags in the HbO2 response between arteries and veins suggest that a process of upstream signalling maybe responsible for dilating the arteries. There was also a consistent increase in Hbr from arterial regions after whisker stimulation.},

However, the hypothesis does not account for the disproportionate increase in flow that occurs in a number of circumstances. There are additional difficulties in reconciling more recent experimental data with the Roy and Sherrington hypothesis.

Low level stimulation ({\{}{\textless}{\}}20 stimuli, 10 Hz) induced a moderated increase of [K(+)](o) ({\{}{\textless}{\}}2 mm increase) in both WT and cKO mice. However, cKO mice exhibited slower recovery of [K(+)](o) levels. With long-lasting stimulation (300 stimuli, 10 Hz), [K(+)](o) in WT and cKO mice displayed characteristic ceiling level ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}2 mm increase) and recovery undershoot, with a more pronounced and prolonged undershoot in cKO mice. In addition, cKO glial cells were more depolarized, and, in contrast to those from WT mice, their membrane potential did not follow the stimulation-induced [K(+)](o) changes, reflecting the loss of their high potassium permeability. Our in vivo results support the role of K(ir)4.1 in setting the membrane potential of glial cells and its contribution to the glial potassium permeability. In addition, our data confirm the necessity of the K(ir)4.1 channel for an efficient uptake of K(+) by glial cells.},

	Abstract = {Despite years of research, delayed cerebral vasospasm remains the feared complication of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Worldwide effort has led to many promising experimental treatments that reverse or prevent cerebral vasospasm but none were confirmed to be effective in clinical trials. There are several sources for this failure: (1) the pathophysiology of delayed cerebral vasospasm remains poorly understood, (2) many experimental models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) do not mimic the actual clinical entity, and (3) many researchers erroneously extrapolate the data of peripheral and cerebral vascular physiological responses to the post-SAH situation. Thus, to explain the uniqueness of vasospasm and to address nitric oxide (NO) involvement in delayed vasospasm development, the following issues are addressed in this paper: (1) pathophysiological mechanisms of vasospasm, (2) NO-related contribution to its development. In addition, (3) a two-stage hypothesis of pathogenesis of delayed cerebral vasospasm is presented developed in the Vascular Laboratory of Surgical Neurology Branch of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke using a primate model of SAH. According to this hypothesis, initially (Phase I) NO-releasing neurons are destroyed by oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) leading to diminished availability of NO in the vessel wall and constriction of the vessels (Phase I). Increased shear stress evoked by narrowing of the arterial lumen should stimulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). But further metabolism of hemoglobin to bilirubin oxidized fragments (BOXes) increases asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of eNOS, in the vicinity of the artery further decreasing of NO availability and sustaining vasospasm (Phase II). In Phase III, the resolution of vasospasm, elimination of BOXes increases NO production by eNOS resulting in recovery of dilatory activity of endothelium. This hypothesis suggests that the key treatment to prevent delayed cerebral vasospasm should be focused on preventing oxyHb neurotoxicity, inhibiting BOX production, and exogenous NO delivery.},

	Abstract = {In the brain, hundreds of intracellular processes are known to depend on calcium influx; hence any substantial fluctuation in external calcium ([Ca2+]o) is likely to engender important functional effects. Employing the known scales and parameters of mammalian neural tissue, we introduce and justify a computational approach to the hypothesis that large changes in local [Ca2+]o will be part of normal neural activity. Using this model, we show that the geometry of the extracellular space in combination with the rapid movement of calcium through ionic channels can cause large external calcium fluctuations, up to 100{\%} depletion in many cases. The exact magnitude of a calcium fluctuation will depend on 1) the size of the consumption zone, 2) the local diffusion coefficient of calcium, and 3) the geometrical arrangement of the consuming elements. Once we have shown that using biologically relevant parameters leads to calcium changes, we focus on the signaling capacity of such concentration fluctuations. Given the sensitivity of neurotransmitter release to [Ca2+]o, the exact position and timing of neural activity will delimit the terminals that are able to release neurotransmitter. Our results indicate that mammalian neural tissue is engineered to generate significant changes in external calcium concentrations during normal activity. This design suggests that such changes play a role in neural information processing.},

	Abstract = {The amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) that accumulates as insoluble plaques in the brain in Alzheimer's disease can be directly neurotoxic and can increase neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxic insults. The mechanism of A beta toxicity is unclear but is believed to involve generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of calcium homeostasis. We now report that exposure of cultured rat hippocampal neurons to A beta 1-40 or A beta 25-35 causes a selective reduction in Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity which precedes loss of calcium homeostasis and cell degeneration. Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity was reduced within 30 min of exposure to A beta 25-35 and declined to less than 40{\%} of basal level by 3 hr. A beta did not impair other Mg(2+)-dependent ATPase activities or Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Experiments with ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase, demonstrated that impairment of this enzyme was sufficient to induce an elevation of [Ca2+]i and neuronal injury. Impairment of Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity appeared to be causally involved in the elevation of [Ca2+]i and neurotoxicity since suppression of Na+ influx significantly reduced A beta- and ouabain-induced [Ca2+]i elevation and neuronal death. Neuronal degeneration induced by ouabain appeared to be of an apoptotic form as indicated by nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. The antioxidant free radical scavengers vitamin E and propylgallate significantly attenuated A beta-induced impairment of Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity, elevation of [Ca2+]i and neurotoxicity, suggesting a role for ROS. Finally, exposure of synaptosomes from postmortem human hippocampus to A beta resulted in a significant and specific reduction in Na+/K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase activities, without affecting other Mg(2+)-dependent ATPase activities or Na+/Ca2+ exchange. These data suggest that impairment of ion-motive ATPases may play a role in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease.},

Scientists and clinicians employ a variety of optical imaging technologies to visualize and study the relationship between neurons, glial cells and blood vessels. In this paper, we present an overview of the current optical approaches used for the in vivo imaging of neurovascular coupling events in small animal models. These techniques include 2-photon microscopy, laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi), functional photoacoustic microscopy (fPAM), functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging (fNIRS) and multimodal imaging techniques. The basic principles of each technique are described in detail, followed by examples of current applications from cutting-edge studies of cerebral neurovascular coupling functions and metabolic. Moreover, we provide a glimpse of the possible ways in which these techniques might be translated to human studies for clinical investigations of pathophysiology and disease. In vivo optical imaging techniques continue to expand and evolve, allowing us to discover fundamental basis of neurovascular coupling roles in cerebral physiology and pathophysiology.},

	Abstract = {Smooth muscle and endothelial cells in the arterial wall are exposed to mechanical stress. Indeed blood flow induces intraluminal pressure variations and shear stress. An increase in pressure may induce a vessel contraction, a phenomenon known as the myogenic response. Many muscular vessels present vasomotion, i.e., rhythmic diameter oscillations caused by synchronous cytosolic calcium oscillations of the smooth muscle cells. Vasomotion has been shown to be modulated by pressure changes. To get a better understanding of the effect of stress and in particular pressure on vasomotion, we propose a model of a blood vessel describing the calcium dynamics in a coupled population of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells and the consequent vessel diameter variations. We show that a rise in pressure increases the calcium concentration. This may either induce or abolish vasomotion, or increase its frequency depending on the initial conditions. In our model the myogenic response is less pronounced for large arteries than for small arteries and occurs at higher values of pressure if the wall thickness is increased. Our results are in agreement with experimental observations concerning a broad range of vessels.},

	Abstract = {Increases in brain blood flow, evoked by neuronal activity, power neural computation and form the basis of BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) functional imaging. Whether blood flow is controlled solely by arteriole smooth muscle, or also by capillary pericytes, is controversial. We demonstrate that neuronal activity and the neurotransmitter glutamate evoke the release of messengers that dilate capillaries by actively relaxing pericytes. Dilation is mediated by prostaglandin E2, but requires nitric oxide release to suppress vasoconstricting 20-HETE synthesis. In vivo, when sensory input increases blood flow, capillaries dilate before arterioles and are estimated to produce 84{\%} of the blood flow increase. In pathology, ischaemia evokes capillary constriction by pericytes. We show that this is followed by pericyte death in rigor, which may irreversibly constrict capillaries and damage the blood-brain barrier. Thus, pericytes are major regulators of cerebral blood flow and initiators of functional imaging signals. Prevention of pericyte constriction and death may reduce the long-lasting blood flow decrease that damages neurons after stroke.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe mechanisms with which neurons communicate with the vasculature to increase blood flow, termed neurovascular coupling is still unclear primarily due to the complex interactions between many parameters and the difficulty in accessing, monitoring and measuring them in the highly heterogeneous brain. Hence a solid theoretical framework based on existing experimental knowledge is necessary to study the relation between neural activity, the associated vasoactive factors released and their effects on the vasculature. Such a framework should also be related to experimental data so that it can be validated against repetitive experiments and generate verifiable hypothesis. We have developed a mathematical model which describes a signaling mechanism of neurovascular coupling with a model of pyramidal neuron and its corresponding fMRI BOLD response. In the first part of two papers we describe the integration of the neurovascular coupling unit extended to include a complex neuron model, which includes the important Na/K ATPase pump, with a model that provides a BOLD signal taking its input from the cerebral blood flow and the metabolic rate of oxygen consumption. We show that this produces a viable signal in terms of initial dip, positive and negative BOLD signals.},

Because NO is both reactive and highly diffusible, its formation must be tightly regulated to control its synthesis and to specify its signaling.

These mechanisms determine both the upstream cellular signals that stimulate NO formation and the downstream molecular targets for NO. Understanding these cellular pathways that control NOS will help us to elucidate the functional roles of NO and provide novel strategies to treat diseases associated with NO abnormalities.},

For example, mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ overload can lead to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, triggering of the permeability transition pore, and cytochrome c release, leading to apoptosis. Despite progress regarding the independent roles of both Ca2+ and mitochondrial dysfunction in disease, the molecular mechanisms by which Ca2+ can elicit mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. This review highlights the delicate balance between the positive and negative effects of Ca2+ and the signaling events that perturb this balance. Overall, a "two-hit" hypothesis is developed, in which Ca2+ plus another pathological stimulus can bring about mitochondrial dysfunction.},

	Abstract = {Endothelial cells of the blood--brain barrier form a structural and functional barrier maintaining brain homeostasis via paracellular tight junctions and specific transporters such as P-glycoprotein. The blood--brain barrier is responsible for negligible bioavailability of many neuroprotective drugs. In Alzheimer's disease, current treatment approaches include inhibitors of BACE-1 ({\$}\beta{\$}-site of amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), a proteinase generating neurotoxic {\$}\beta{\$}-amyloid. It is known that BACE-1 is highly expressed in endosomes and membranes of neurons and glia. We now provide evidence that BACE-1 is expressed in blood--brain barrier endothelial cells of human, mouse, and bovine origin. We further show its predominant membrane localization by 3D-dSTORM super-resolution microscopy, and by biochemical fractionation that further shows an abluminal distribution of BACE-1 in brain microvessels. We confirm its functionality in processing APP in primary mouse brain endothelial cells. In an Alzheimer's disease mouse model we show that BACE-1 is upregulated at the blood--brain barrier compared to healthy controls. We therefore suggest a critical role for BACE-1 at the blood--brain barrier in {\$}\beta{\$}-amyloid generation and in vascular aspects of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.},

	Abstract = {In the modeling of the pulse wave in the systemic arterial tree, it is necessary to truncate small arterial crowns representing the networks of small arteries and arterioles. Appropriate boundary conditions at the truncation points are required to represent wave reflection effects of the truncated arterial crowns. In this work, we provide a systematic method to extract parameters of the three-element Windkessel model from the impedance of a truncated arterial tree or from experimental measurements of the blood pressure and flow rate at the inlet of the truncated arterial crown. In addition, we propose an improved three-element Windkessel model with a complex capacitance to accurately capture the fundamental-frequency time lag of the reflection wave with respect to the incident wave. Through our numerical simulations of blood flow in a single artery and in a large arterial tree, together with the analysis of the modeling error of the pulse wave in large arteries, we show that both a small truncation radius and the complex capacitance in the improved Windkessel model play an important role in reducing the modeling error, defined as the difference in dynamics induced by the structured tree model and the Windkessel models.},

	Abstract = {The temperature distribution and rate of heat transfer across an infinite periodic strip of a honeycomb lattice consisting of conductive segments or links joined at nodes or junctions is discussed. A pristine honeycomb behaves like an isotropic medium whose effective conductivity is independent of the orientation of an applied macroscopic temperature gradient. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the effect of link damage or disruption and lattice deformation due to junction displacement. In the simulations, a specified percentage of randomly distributed links are assigned a conductivity that is lower than that of the undamaged links. The balance equations governing the nodal temperatures at the junctions are solved by iteration subject to a periodicity condition along the strip and the Dirichlet condition along the two infinite edges of the strip. The results illustrate the effect of imperfections on the temperature distribution over the network and document the dependence of the effective conductivity on the percentage and conductivity of the defective links. In the case of nonconductive damaged links, the effective conductivity becomes nearly zero when a critical percentage of links are clipped, in agreement with bond percolation theory. However, the functional form of the number density of possible pathways connecting the lower to the upper edge of the strip predicted by percolation theory differs from that of the effective conductivity. Lattice deformation due to random node displacement has a small effect on the effective conductivity of the network. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Synaptic transmission initiates a cascade of signal transduction events that couple neuronal activity to local changes in blood flow and oxygenation. Although a number of vasoactive molecules and specific cell types have been implicated, the transformation of stimulus-induced activation of neuronal circuits to hemodynamic changes is still unclear. We use somatosensory stimulation and a suite of in vivo imaging tools to study neurovascular coupling in rat primary somatosensory cortex. Our stimulus evoked a central region of net neuronal depolarization surrounded by net hyperpolarization. Hemodynamic measurements revealed that predominant depolarization corresponded to an increase in oxygenation, whereas predominant hyperpolarization corresponded to a decrease in oxygenation. On the microscopic level of single surface arterioles, the response was composed of a combination of dilatory and constrictive phases. Critically, the relative strength of vasoconstriction covaried with the relative strength of oxygenation decrease and neuronal hyperpolarization. These results suggest that a neuronal inhibition and concurrent arteriolar vasoconstriction correspond to a decrease in blood oxygenation, which would be consistent with a negative blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signal.},

	Abstract = {We have examined the extracellular pH (pHe) during spreading depression and complete cerebral ischemia in rat parietal cortex utilizing double-barrelled H+ liquid ion exchanger microelectrodes. The baseline pHe of the parietal cortex was 7.33 at a mean arterial PCO2 of 38 mm Hg. Following spreading depression and cerebral ischemia, highly reproducible triphasic changes in pHe occurred, which were intimately related to the negative deflection in tissue potential (Ve). The changes in pHe for spreading depression (n = 23) were a small initial acidic shift, beginning before the rapid change in Ve, followed by a rapid transient alkaline shift of 0.16 pH units, the onset of which coincided with the negative deflection in Ve. A prolonged acidic shift of 0.42 pH units then occurred. The maximal decrease in pHe was to 6.97 and the mean duration of the triphasic pHe change was 7.8 min. The lactate concentration in brain cortex increased from baseline 1.2 mM to 7.0 mM (n = 6) during the maximal acidic change in spreading depression. In addition, lactate levels correlated well with resolution of the pHe changes during spreading depression. The triphasic pHe changes following complete cerebral ischemia were an initial acidic shift of 0.43 pH units which developed over 2 min, then an alkaline shift of 0.10 pH units coincident with the negative deflection in Ve, and a final acidic shift of 0.26 pH units. The terminal pHe was 6.75. Superfusion of the cortex with inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase (acetazolamide), Na+/H+ counter transport (amiloride), and Cl-/HCO-3 countertransport (4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) altered the triphasic pHe changes in a similar fashion for both spreading depression and cerebral ischemia, providing insights into the pHe regulatory mechanisms in mammalian brain.},

	Abstract = {It has been postulated that the development of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result from an imbalance between the generation and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Although familial AD appears to be caused by Abeta overproduction, sporadic AD (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. Recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of Abeta. Furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of Abeta degradation. In this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular Abeta degradation. We found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 mice. Moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) degraded Abeta, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). This activity was attenuated with specific inhibitors of MMP-2 and -9, as well as in ACM derived from mmp-2 or -9 knock-out (KO) mice. In vivo, significant increases in the steady-state levels of Abeta were found in the brains of mmp-2 and -9 KO mice compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the MMPs with N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide (GM 6001) increased brain interstitial fluid Abeta levels and elimination of half-life in APPsw mice. These results suggest that MMP-2 and -9 may contribute to extracellular brain Abeta clearance by promoting Abeta catabolism.},

	Abstract = {A better knowledge of the flow and pressure distribution in realistic microvascular networks is needed for improving our understanding of neurovascular coupling mechanisms and the related measurement techniques. Here, numerical simulations with discrete tracking of red blood cells (RBCs) are performed in three realistic microvascular networks from the mouse cerebral cortex. Our analysis is based on trajectories of individual RBCs and focuses on layer-specific flow phenomena until a cortical depth of 1 mm. The individual RBC trajectories reveal that in the capillary bed RBCs preferentially move in plane. Hence, the capillary flow field shows laminar patterns and a layer-specific analysis is valid. We demonstrate that for RBCs entering the capillary bed close to the cortical surface ({\textless}400 {\$}\mu{\$}m) the largest pressure drop takes place in the capillaries (37{\%}), while for deeper regions arterioles are responsible for 61{\%} of the total pressure drop. Further flow characteristics, such as capillary transit time or RBC velocity, also vary significantly over cortical depth. Comparison of purely topological characteristics with flow-based ones shows that a combined interpretation of topology and flow is indispensable. Our results provide evidence that it is crucial to consider layer-specific differences for all investigations related to the flow and pressure distribution in the cortical vasculature. These findings support the hypothesis that for an efficient oxygen up-regulation at least two regulation mechanisms must be playing hand in hand, namely cerebral blood flow increase and microvascular flow homogenization. However, the contribution of both regulation mechanisms to oxygen up-regulation likely varies over depth.},

	Abstract = {The spatiotemporal activities of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in mature neuronal circuits remain unclear. We used genetically encoded Ca2+ and glutamate indicators as well as pharmacogenetic and electrical control of neurotransmitter release to explore astrocyte activity in the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway. Our data revealed numerous localized, spontaneous Ca2+ signals in astrocyte branches and territories, but these were not driven by neuronal activity or glutamate. Moreover, evoked astrocyte Ca2+ signaling changed linearly with the number of mossy fiber action potentials. Under these settings, astrocyte responses were global, suppressed by neurotransmitter clearance, and mediated by glutamate and GABA. Thus, astrocyte engagement in the fully developed mossy fiber pathway was slow and territorial, contrary to that frequently proposed for astrocytes within microcircuits. We show that astrocyte Ca2+ signaling functionally segregates large volumes of neuropil and that these transients are not suited for responding to, or regulating, single synapses in the mossy fiber pathway. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous contraction and relaxation of arteries (and in some instances venules) has been termed vasomotion and has been observed in an extensive variety of tissues and species. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. We demonstrate that in vivo spectrophotometry, measured simultaneously with extracellular recordings at the same locations in the visual thalamus of the cat, reveals vasomotion, measured as an oscillation (0.14 hz) in the recorded oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) signal, which appears spontaneously in the microcirculation and can last for periods of hours. During some non-oscillatory periods, maintained sensory stimulation evokes vasomotion lasting {\~{}}30s, resembling an adaptive vascular phenomenon. This oscillation in the oxyhaemoblobin signal is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation: it is inducible by chloralose anaesthesia and it can be temporarily blocked by systemic administration of adrenaline or acetylcholine (ACh). During these oscillatory periods, neurovascular coupling (i.e. the relationship between local neural activity and the rate of blood supply to that location) appears significantly altered. This raises important questions with regard to the interpretation of results from studies currently dependent upon a linear relationship between neural activity and blood flow, such as neuroimaging.},

	Abstract = {Arterioles display cyclic variations in diameter, termed vasomotion initiated by smooth muscle cells (SMCs), but the endothelium should also be evaluated due to its modulatory role on vessel tone. Since nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) regulate SMC tone and activate K+ currents, we have investigated their role on vasomotion, by observing effects of topical application of N$\omega$-nitro-l-arginine (L-NA, NO synthesis inhibitor), glibenclamide (KATP channel inhibitor), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), iloprost (PGI2 analogue) and methylene blue (MB, cGMP production inhibitor) on the cheek pouch preparation of anesthetized male hamsters. L-NA (10-10-10-6M) induced vasoconstriction, reduction and abolition of vasomotion. MB (10-7 to 10-5M) reduced mean arteriolar diameter with no changes on vasomotion. In the presence of 10-6M of MB, addition of 10-6L-NA totally abolished vasomotion without further constriction. Glibenclamide (10-6M) in the presence of L-NA at equimolar concentration restored both vasomotion frequency and amplitude. This effect was not observed in the presence of TEA 5mM. SNP (10-10-10-6M) induced a dose-dependent increase of arteriolar diameter and decreased vasomotion. Iloprost (10-12-10-6M) induced a concentration dependent increase of arteriolar diameter, reduced vasomotion frequency, but in lower concentrations (10-12-10-10M) increased its amplitude and in higher concentrations (10-9-10-6M) decreased it. SNP and iloprost inhibited vasomotion at 10-7M; however, at this concentration SNP and iloprost induced an increment of 35{\%} and 50{\%} of the initial arteriolar diameter, respectively. In the presence of L-NA (10-6M), vasomotion was restored by SNP at 10-10M and iloprost 10-12M, which corresponded to 80{\%} of the initial diameter value. Around the initial (control) arteriolar diameter value, vasomotion presented its highest frequencies and amplitudes. Cessation of vasomotion occurred with L-NA (10-6M) in the presence of SNP (10-6M) and iloprost (10-7M) when arteriolar diameter reached 150{\%} and 120{\%} of its initial value, respectively. In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests that vasomotion (1) is not solely related to vascular tone, (2) needs an interplay between vascular tone and membrane currents and (3) could be modulated by NO (but not cGMP) and KATP channels. In addition, our results point to the existence of dissociation between vasomotion frequency and amplitude. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {We construct a minimal model of cytosolic free Ca2+ oscillations based on Ca2+ release via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor/Ca2+ channel (IP3R) of a single intracellular Ca2+ pool. The model relies on experimental evidence that the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c) modulates the IP3R in a biphasic manner, with Ca2+ release inhibited by low and high [Ca2+]c and facilitated by intermediate [Ca2+]c, and that channel inactivation occurs on a slower time scale than activation. The model produces [Ca2+]c oscillations at constant [IP3] and reproduces a number of crucial experiments. The two-dimensional spatial model with IP3 dynamics, cytosolic diffusion of IP3 (Dp = 300 microns 2 s-1), and cytosolic diffusion of Ca2+ (Dc = 20 microns 2 s-1) produces circular, planar, and spiral waves of Ca2+ with speeds of 7--15 microns.s-1, which annihilate upon collision. Increasing extracellular [Ca2+] influx increases wave speed and baseline [Ca2+]c. A [Ca2+]c-dependent Ca2+ diffusion coefficient does not alter the qualitative behavior of the model. An important model prediction is that channel inactivation must occur on a slower time scale than activation in order for waves to propagate. The model serves to capture the essential macroscopic mechanisms that are involved in the production of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and traveling waves in the Xenopus laevis oocyte. {\textcopyright} 1993, The Biophysical Society.

	Abstract = {1. We examined the effects of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA), on the activities of the ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels of rat cardiac myocytes, using the inside-out patch-clamp technique. 2. In the presence of 100 microM cytoplasmic ATP, the K(ATP) channel open probability (P(o)) was increased by 240 +/- 60 {\%} with 0.1 microM 11,12-EET and by 400 +/- 54 {\%} with 5 microM 11,12-EET (n = 5-10, P {\textless}0.05 vs. control), whereas neither 5 microM AA nor 5 microM 11,12-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET), which is the epoxide hydrolysis product of 11,12-EET, had any effect on P(o). 3. The half-maximal activating concentration (EC(50)) was 18.9 +/- 2.6 nM for 11,12-EET (n = 5) and 19.1 +/- 4.8 nM for 8,9-EET (n = 5, P = n.s. vs. 11,12-EET). Furthermore, 11,12-EET failed to alter the inhibition of K(ATP) channels by glyburide. 4. Application of 11,12-EET markedly decreased the channel sensitivity to cytoplasmic ATP. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of ATP (IC(50)) was increased from 21.2 +/- 2.0 microM at baseline to 240 +/- 60 microM with 0.1 microM 11,12-EET (n = 5, P {\textless}0.05 vs. control) and to 780 +/- 30 microM with 5 microM 11,12-EET (n = 11, P {\textless}0.05 vs. control). 5. Increasing the ATP concentration increased the number of kinetically distinguishable closed states, promoting prolonged closure durations. 11,12-EET antagonized the effects of ATP on the kinetics of the K(ATP) channels in a dose- and voltage-dependent manner. 11,12-EET (1 microM) reduced the apparent association rate constant of ATP to the channel by 135-fold. 6. Application of 5 microM 11,12-EET resulted in hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential in isolated cardiac myocytes, which could be blocked by glyburide. 7. These results suggest that EETs are potent activators of the cardiac K(ATP) channels, modulating channel behaviour by reducing the channel sensitivity to ATP. Thus, EETs could be important endogenous regulators of cardiac electrical excitability.},

	Abstract = {Most functional brain imaging studies use task-induced hemodynamic responses to infer underlying changes in neuronal activity. In addition to increases in cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals, sustained negative responses are pervasive in functional imaging. The origin of negative responses and their relationship to neural activity remain poorly understood. Through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological recording, we demonstrate a negative BOLD response (NBR) beyond the stimulated regions of visual cortex, associated with local decreases in neuronal activity below spontaneous activity, detected 7.15 +/- 3.14 mm away from the closest positively responding region in V1. Trial-by-trial amplitude fluctuations revealed tight coupling between the NBR and neuronal activity decreases. The NBR was associated with comparable decreases in local field potentials and multiunit activity. Our findings indicate that a significant component of the NBR originates in neuronal activity decreases.},

Unlike many other second-messenger mo!ecules, Ca 2÷ is required for life, yet prolonged high intracellular Ca 2÷ levels lead to cell death. Ca 2+ cannot be metabolized like other second-messenger molecules, so cells tightly regulate intracellular levels through numerous binding and specialized extrusion proteins. Normal intra- cellular Ca 2+ levels at - 100 nM are 20,000-fold lower than the 2 mM concentration found extracellularly. Scores of cellular proteins have been adapted to bind Ca 2+ tightly, in some cases simply to buffer or lower free Ca 2+ levels, and in others to trigger second-messenger pathways. The well-known basic elements in Ca 2÷ signal transduction have been extensively reviewed (Berridge, 1993; Carafoli, 1992; Clapham and Neer, 1993; Pozzan et al., 1994; Rhee, 1991; Tsien and Tsien, 1990).

	Abstract = {Stimulation of type-1 astrocytes, by a number of agonists, has been shown to increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in an oscillatory manner. However, it is unknown how these are driven or altered by aging, injury or disease. Therefore, we characterized the signaling properties of rat type-1 astrocytes in monolayer cultures. Ca2+ responses were recorded in astrocytes stimulated with ATP or glutamate. Oscillations were evident in cultures at 3 days in vitro (DIV 3) with a peak percentage (26{\%}) of cells responding by DIV 7. The presence or absence of serum in the culture medium did not influence this percentage. Likewise, long-term culture (DIV 30+) did not increase the oscillating cell numbers. ATP was found to have a more potent effective dose (50 microM) than glutamate (10 mM). Membrane potential was recorded with fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (membrane potential dye for FLIPR) and was similar regardless of the culture age and intracellular Ca2+ response. This suggests that mechanisms associated with the intracellular release of Ca2+ from endogenous Ca2+ stores, rather than ion fluxes across the plasma membrane, may contribute to the oscillations in the astrocytes. In order to identify a possible pathological significance of this response, we transfected astrocytes with wild-type presenilin (PS1) as well as PS1 harboring a mutation linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). PS mutation expressing astrocytes oscillated at lower ATP and glutamate concentrations when compared to wild-type PS1 expressing astrocytes. This indicates that PS1 mutation may introduce aberrations in the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in astrocytes contributing to the accelerated pathogenesis in FAD.},

@article{Stansberry1996,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that vasomotion, the rhythmic contraction exhibited by small arteries and arterioles, is impaired in diabetic subjects compared with healthy control subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We mathematically modeled the oscillations in laser Doppler microvascular measurements taken from the pulpar surface of the index finger in 20 healthy control subjects and 20 age-matched diabetic subjects (8 with type I and 12 with type II diabetes). The mean duration of diabetes was 17.1 +/- 2.3 years, and mean HbA1c was 9.1 +/- 0.4{\%}. Blood flow was measured for 5 min as subjects rested quietly in a closed room. Fast Fourier transformation was performed to provide the frequency power spectrum of each recording. Amplitude of vasomotion was correlated with six quantitative measurements of neuropathy. RESULTS: Diabetic subjects had impaired low-frequency oscillation vasomotion in 75{\%} of age-matched patients (15 of 20 patients), with mean amplitudes of 24.9 +/- 6.4 vs. 129.0 +/- 33.2 (P {\textless} 0.0039). Of six somatic and autonomic neuropathy variables, only the warm thermal sensory threshold correlated significantly with the mean amplitude of vasomotion (r = -0.75, P {\textless} 0.0009). CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of peripheral vasomotion are clearly disordered in diabetes. The loss of low-frequency oscillations observed here suggests a peripheral vascular abnormality that extends past the capillary network to arterial vessels. It is uncertain whether the accompanying small unmyelinated nerve C-fiber dysfunction is a cause or consequence of the impaired microvascular function. Measurement of vasomotion may prove useful as a novel test for peripheral neurovascular function.},

	Abstract = {Neurovascular coupling, or functional hyperaemia, refers to complex mechanisms of communication between neurons, astrocytes and cerebral vessels which form the neurovascular unit that spatially and temporally adjusts blood supply to the needs in energy and oxygen of activated neurons. Neurovascular coupling is so precise that it underlies neuroimaging techniques to map changes in neuronal activity. Therefore, understanding its basis is indispensable for the proper interpretation of imaging signals from functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, routinely used in humans. Although neurovascular coupling mechanisms are not yet fully understood, considerable progress has been made over the last decade. In this review, we present recent knowledge from in vivo studies on the cortical cellular network involved in neurovascular coupling responses and the mediators implicated in these haemodynamic changes. Recent findings have emphasized the intricate interplay between both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in neurovascular coupling, together with an intermediary role of astrocytes, which are ideally positioned between neurons and microvessels. Finally, we describe latest findings on the alterations of neurovascular function encountered in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {L-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid with a number of bioactive metabolites. Accumulating evidence suggests the implication of altered arginine metabolism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study systematically compared the metabolic profile of L-arginine in the superior frontal gyrus, hippocampus, and cerebellum from AD (mean age 80years) and normal (mean age 80 or 60years) cases. The activity and protein expression of nitric oxide synthase and arginase were altered with AD and age in a region-specific manner. There were also AD- and age-related changes in the tissue concentrations of L-arginine and its downstream metabolites (L-citrulline, L-ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, glutamate, ??-aminobutyric acid, and glutamine) in a metabolite- or region-specific manner. These findings demonstrate that arginine metabolism is dramatically altered in diverse regions of AD brains, thus meriting further investigation to understand its role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of the disease. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {We have used Monte Carlo simulations to understand the generation of quantal responses at the single active zones of CA1 synapses. We constructed a model of AMPA channel activation that accounts for the responses to controlled glutamate application and a model of glutamate diffusion in the synaptic cleft. With no further adjustments to these models, we simulated the response to the release of glutamate from a single vesicle. The predicted response closely matches the rise time of observed responses, which recent measurements show is much faster ({\textless}100 micros) than previously thought. The simulations show that initial channel opening is driven by a brief ({\textless}100 micros) glutamate spike near the site of vesicle fusion, producing a hotspot of channel activation (diameter: approximately 250 nm) smaller than many synapses. Quantal size therefore depends more strongly on the density of channels than their number, a finding that has important implications for measuring synaptic strength. Recent measurements allow estimation of AMPA receptor density at CA1 synapses. Using this value, our simulations correctly predicts a quantal amplitude of approximately 10 pA. We have also analyzed the properties of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) generated by the multivesicular release that can occur during evoked responses. We find that summation is nearly linear and that the existence of multiple narrow peaks in amplitude histograms can be accounted for. It has been unclear how to reconcile the existence of these narrow peaks, which indicate that the variation of quantal amplitude is small (CV {\textless} 0.2) with the highly variable amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs; CV approximately 0.6). According to one theory, mEPSC variability arises from variation in vesicle glutamate content. However, both our modeling results and recent experimental results indicate that this view cannot account for the observed rise time/amplitude correlation of mEPSCs. In contrast, this correlation and the high mEPSC variability can be accounted for if some mEPSCs are generated by two or more vesicles released with small temporal jitter. We conclude that a broad range of results can be accounted for by simple principles: quantal amplitude (approximately 10 pA) is stereotyped, some mEPSCs are multivesicular at moderate and large synapses, and evoked responses are generated by quasi-linear summation of multiple quanta.},

In order to differentiate the contributions of each cell type to the hemodynamic response during stimulation and resting state, intrinsic optical signal (IOI) was recorded synchronized with fluorescence imaging of calcium concentration sensitive dye Oregon Green BAPTA-1 AM. By changing the stimulation parameters (frequency and duration), it was possible to individually promote neuronal and glial responses and to compare them to levels of oxy (HbO), deoxy (HbR) and total (HbT) hemoglobin concentrations. Finally, resting state recordings were done to investigate the possible correlation between hemoglobin fluctuation and calcium transients, based on different frequency bands associated either with neuronal or glial activity.},

The NVU controls blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow, and maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal 'milieu', which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits. Recent evidence indicates that BBB dysfunction is associated with the accumulation of several vasculotoxic and neurotoxic molecules within brain parenchyma, a reduction in cerebral blood flow, and hypoxia. Together, these vascular-derived insults might initiate and/or contribute to neuronal degeneration. This article examines mechanisms of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer's disease, and highlights therapeutic opportunities relating to these neurovascular deficits.},

It is believed that the environmental risk factors play an important role in the onset and development of AD. Patients suffering from cerebral ischemia and stroke in which hypoxic conditions occur are much more susceptible to AD. Increasing evidence suggests that hypoxia facilitates the pathogenesis of AD through accelerating the accumulation of Abeta, increasing the hyperphosphorylation of tau, impairing the normal functions of blood-brain barrier, and promoting the degeneration of neurons. Further investigations into the relationship between hypoxia and AD may open the avenue for effective preservation and pharmacological treatments of this neurodegenerative disease.},

	Abstract = {The Circle of Willis is a ring-like structure of blood vessels found beneath the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. Its main function is to distribute oxygen-rich arterial blood to the cerebral mass. One-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the Circle of Willis have been created to provide a simulation tool which can potentially be used to identify at-risk cerebral arterial geometries and conditions and replicate clinical scenarios, such as occlusions in afferent arteries and absent circulus vessels. Both models capture cerebral haemodynamic autoregulation using a proportional-integral (PI) controller to modify efferent artery resistances to maintain optimal efferent flow rates for a given circle geometry and afferent blood pressure. The models can be used to identify at-risk cerebral arterial geometries and conditions prior to surgery or other clinical procedures. The 1D model is particularly relevant in this instance, with its fast solution time suitable for real-time clinical decisions. Results show the excellent correlation between models for the transient efferent flux profile. The assumption of strictly Poiseuille flow in the 1D model allows more flow through the geometrically extreme communicating arteries than the 3D model. This discrepancy was overcome by increasing the resistance to flow in the anterior communicating artery in the 1D model to better match the resistance seen in the 3D results.},

We focus on the design and control of spatiotemporal dynamics in excitable and oscillatory media. Experimental examples are taken from the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction and the oxidation reaction of CO on single crystal Pt, which have become paradigmatic chemical systems for studies of spatiotemporal dynamics. We present theoretical characterizations of spatiotemporal dynamics and control based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as well as models of the BZ and CO/Pt reactions. Controlling spatiotemporal dynamics allows the realization of specific modes of behavior or may give rise to completely new types of behavior. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Rate equations for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release and plasma membrane Ca2+ transport were determined from the measured fluxes in the preceding study and incorporated into a model of Ca2+ dynamics. It was asked if the measured fluxes are sufficient to account for the [Ca2+](i), recovery kinetics after depolarization-evoked [Ca2+](i) elevations. Ca2+ transport across the plasma membrane was described by a parallel extrusion/leak system, while the rates of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release were represented using equations like those describing Ca2+ transport by isolated mitochondria. Taken together, these rate descriptions account very well for the time course of recovery after [Ca2+](i) elevations evoked by weak and strong depolarization and their differential sensitivity to FCCP, CGP 37157, and [Na+](i). The model also leads to three general conclusions about mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in intact cells: (1) mitochondria are expected to accumulate Ca2+ even in response to stimuli that raise [Ca2+](i) only slightly above resting levels; (2) there are two qualitatively different stimulus regimes that parallel the buffering and non-buffering modes of Ca2+ transport by isolated mitochondria that have been described previously; (3) the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport on intracellular calcium dynamics is strongly influenced by nonmitochondrial Ca2+ transport; in particular, the magnitude of the prolonged [Ca2+](i) elevation that occurs during the plateau phase of recovery is related to the Ca2+ set-point described in studies of isolated mitochondria, but is a property of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in a cellular context. Finally, the model resolves the paradoxical finding that stimulus-induced [Ca2+](i) elevations as small as similar to 300 nM increase intramitochondrial total Ca2+ concentration, but die steady [Ca2+](i) elevations evoked by such stimuli are not influenced by FCCP.},

	Abstract = {A substantial body of evidence supports the hypothesis of a vascular component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral hypoperfusion and blood-brain barrier dysfunction have been indicated as key elements of this pathway. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebrovascular disorder, frequent in AD, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in cerebral blood vessel walls. CAA is associated with loss of vascular integrity, resulting in impaired regulation of cerebral circulation, and increased susceptibility to cerebral ischemia, microhemorrhages, and white matter damage. Vasomotion-the spontaneous rhythmic modulation of arterial diameter, typically observed in arteries/arterioles in various vascular beds including the brain-is thought to participate in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery regulation. Vasomotion is impaired in adverse conditions such as hypoperfusion and hypoxia. The perivascular and glymphatic pathways of Abeta clearance are thought to be driven by the systolic pulse. Vasomotion produces diameter changes of comparable amplitude, however at lower rates, and could contribute to these mechanisms of Abeta clearance. In spite of potential clinical interest, studies addressing cerebral vasomotion in the context of AD/CAA are limited. This study reviews the current literature on vasomotion, and hypothesizes potential paths implicating impaired cerebral vasomotion in AD/CAA. Abeta and oxidative stress cause vascular tone dysregulation through direct effects on vascular cells, and indirect effects mediated by impaired neurovascular coupling. Vascular tone dysregulation is further aggravated by cholinergic deficit and results in depressed cerebrovascular reactivity and (possibly) impaired vasomotion, aggravating regional hypoperfusion and promoting further Abeta and oxidative stress accumulation},

	Abstract = {Both the skeletal muscle and skin of humans possess remarkable abilities to vasodilate. Marked vasodilation can be seen in these vascular beds in response to a variety of common physiological stimuli. These stimuli include reactive hyperemia (skin and muscle), exercise hyperemia (muscle), mental stress (muscle), and whole body heating (skin). The physiological mechanisms that cause vasodilation in response to these stimuli are poorly understood, and the substance(s) responsible for it remain unclear. In this context, recent attention has been focused on the possible contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to the regulation of hyperemic responses in human skin and skeletal muscle. The emerging picture is that NO is not an essential component of the dilator response seen during reactive hyperemia. However, it does appear that NO may play a modest role in exercise hyperemia. NO appears to play a major role in the skeletal muscle vasodilation seen in response to mental stress in humans. Preliminary evidence also indicates that NO is not essential for the normal dilator responses observed in the cutaneous circulation during body heating in humans, but this issue needs further study. There are a number of possible mechanisms that might mediate NO release in humans, and the role of these mechanisms in the various hyperemic responses is also poorly understood. The role of altered NO-mediated vasodilation in some disease states is also discussed. Whereas NO is a potent vasodilating substance, the actions of NO alone do not explain a variety of poorly understood vasodilator mechanisms in conscious humans. Much work remains for those interested in the role of NO in the regulation of blood flow to the skin and skeletal muscle of humans.},

	Abstract = {The ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels are pivotal to signal transduction and cell function in many cell types, including cardiac myocytes. In this paper a kinetic model is proposed for these channels. In the model there are two Ca regulatory sites on the channel protein, one positive and the other negative. Cytoplasmic Ca binds to these regulatory sites independently It is assumed that the binding of Ca to the positive site is a much faster process than binding to the negative site. At steady state, the channel opening as a function of the Ca concentration is a bell-shaped curve. The model predicts the adaptation of channels to constant Ca stimulus. When this model is applied to cardiac myocytes, it predicts excitability with respect to Ca perturbations, smoothly graded responses, and Ca oscillations in certain pathological circumstances. In a spatially distributed system, traveling Ca waves in individual myocytes exist under certain conditions. This model can also be applied to other systems where the ryanodine-sensitive channels have been identified.},

Here we investigated the spatial detail of neurovascular events with a combination of high spatiotemporal resolution two-dimensional spectroscopic optical imaging, multichannel electrode recordings and cytochrome oxidase histology in the rodent whisker barrel field. After mechanical stimulation of a single whisker, we found two spatially distinct cortical hemodynamic responses: a transient response in the "upstream" branches of surface arteries and a later highly localized increase in blood volume centered on the activated cortical column. Although the spatial representation of this localized response exceeded that of a single "barrel," the spread of hemodynamic activity accurately reflected the neural response in neighboring columns rather than being due to a passive "overspill." These data confirm hemodynamics are capable of providing accurate "single-condition" maps of neural activity.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes participate in brain functions through Ca(2+) signals, including Ca(2+) waves and Ca(2+) oscillations. Currently the mechanisms of Ca(2+) signals in astrocytes are not fully clear. Here, we present a computational model to specify the relative contributions of different Ca(2+) flows between the extracellular space, the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum of astrocytes to the generation of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations (CASs) and cortical spreading depression (CSD)-triggered Ca(2+) waves (CSDCWs) in a one-dimensional astrocyte network. This model shows that CASs depend primarily on Ca(2+) released from internal stores of astrocytes, and CSDCWs depend mainly on voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx. It predicts that voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx is able to generate Ca(2+) waves during the process of CSD even after depleting internal Ca(2+) stores. Furthermore, the model investigates the interactions between CASs and CSDCWs and shows that the pass of CSDCWs suppresses CASs, whereas CASs do not prevent the generation of CSDCWs. This work quantitatively analyzes the generation of astrocytic Ca(2+) signals and indicates different mechanisms underlying CSDCWs and non-CSDCWs. Research on the different types of Ca(2+) signals might help to understand the ways by which astrocytes participate in information processing in brain functions.},

	Abstract = {In many cell types, asynchronous or synchronous oscillations in the concentration of intracellular free calcium occur in adjacent cells that are coupled by gap junctions. Such oscillations are believed to underlie oscillatory intercellular calcium waves in some cell types, and thus it is important to understand how they occur and are modified by intercellular coupling. Using a previous model of intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells, this article explores the effects of coupling two cells with a simple linear diffusion term. Depending on the concentration of a signal molecule, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, coupling two identical cells by diffusion can give rise to synchronized in-phase oscillations, as well as different-amplitude in-phase oscillations and same-amplitude antiphase oscillations. Coupling two nonidentical cells leads to more complex behaviors such as cascades of period doubling and multiply periodic solutions. This study is a first step towards understanding the role and significance of the diffusion of calcium through gap junctions in the coordination of oscillatory calcium waves in a variety of cell types.

	Abstract = {An integrative, systems approach to the modelling of brain energy metabolism is presented. Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular potassium concentration, [K(+)](o), and intracellular calcium, [Ca(2+)](i), rise during neuron excitation, seizures and spreading depression. Astrocytes probably restrain the rise of K(+) in a way that is only partly understood. To examine the effect of glial K(+) uptake, we used a model neuron equipped with Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+) and Cl(-) conductances, ion pumps and ion exchangers, surrounded by interstitial space and glia. The glial membrane was either "passive", incorporating only leak channels and an ion exchange pump, or it had rectifying K(+) channels. We computed ion fluxes, concentration changes and osmotic volume changes. Increase of [K(+)](o) stimulated the glial uptake by the glial 3Na/2K ion pump. The [K(+)](o) flux through glial leak and rectifier channels was outward as long as the driving potential was outwardly directed, but it turned inward when rising [K(+)](o)/[K(+)](i) ratio reversed the driving potential. Adjustments of glial membrane parameters influenced the neuronal firing patterns, the length of paroxysmal afterdischarge and the ignition point of spreading depression. We conclude that voltage gated K(+) currents can boost the effectiveness of the glial "potassium buffer" and that this buffer function is important even at moderate or low levels of excitation, but especially so in pathological states.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical and numerical model is developed for the adhesion of platelets in stagnation point flow. The model provides for a correct representation of the axi-symmetric flow and explicitly uses shear rate to characterise not only the convective transport but also the simple surface reaction mechanism used to model platelet adhesion at the wall surface. Excellent agreement exists between the analytical solution and that obtained by the numerical integration of the full Navier--Stokes equations and decoupled conservation of species equations. It has been shown that for a constant wall reaction rate modelling platelet adhesion the maximum platelet flux occurs at the stagnation point streamline. This is in direct contrast to that found in experiment where the maximum platelet deposition occurs at some distance downstream of the stagnation point. However, if the wall reaction rate is chosen to be dependent on the wall shear stress then the analysis shows that the maximum platelet flux occurs downstream of the stagnation point, providing a more realistic model of experimental evidence. The analytical formulation is applicable to a large number of two-dimensional and axi-symmetrical surface reaction flows where the wall shear stress is known a priori.},

	Abstract = {Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a major role in a variety of brain functions, as well as in disorders such as Parkinson disease and schizophrenia. In cultured astrocytes, we have found that dopamine induces sporadic cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca(2+)](c)) signals. Importantly, we show that the dopamine-induced calcium signaling is receptor-independent in midbrain, cortical, and hippocampal astrocytes. We demonstrate that the calcium signal is initiated by the metabolism of dopamine by monoamine oxidase, which produces reactive oxygen species and induces lipid peroxidation. This stimulates the activation of phospholipase C and subsequent release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor mechanism. These findings have major implications on the function of astrocytes that are exposed to dopamine and may contribute to understanding the physiological role of dopamine.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. In connection with the global trend of prolonging human life and the increasing number of elderly in the population, the AD becomes one of the most serious health and socioeconomic problems of the present. Tau protein promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, which contributes to the proper function of neuron. Alterations in the amount or the structure of tau protein can affect its role as a stabilizer of microtubules as well as some of the processes in which it is implicated. The molecular mechanisms governing tau aggregation are mainly represented by several posttranslational modifications that alter its structure and conformational state. Hence, abnormal phosphorylation and truncation of tau protein have gained attention as key mechanisms that become tau protein in a pathological entity. Evidences about the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated and truncated tau have been documented during the progression of AD as well as their capacity to exert cytotoxicity when expressed in cell and animal models. This paper describes the normal structure and function of tau protein and its major alterations during its pathological aggregation in AD.},

@article{Moradi2013,
	Abstract = {Prolonged visual stimulation results in neurophysiologic and hemodynamic adaptation. However, the hemodynamic adaptation appears to be small compared to neural adaptation. It is not clear how the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is affected by adaptation. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CMRO2 change in responses to peripheral stimulation either continuously, or intermittently (on/off cycles). A linear system's response to the continuous input should be equal to the sum of the original response to the intermittent input and a version of that response shifted by half a cycle. The CMRO2 response showed a large non-linearity consistent with adaptation, the CBF response adapted to a lesser degree, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response was nearly linear. The metabolic response was coupled with a larger flow in the continuous condition than in the intermittent condition. Our results suggest that contrast adaptation improves energy economy of visual processing. However BOLD modulations may not accurately represent the underlying metabolic nonlinearity due to modulation of the coupling of blood flow and oxygen metabolism changes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Although the exact causes of AD are still unclear, evidence suggests that atherosclerosis, redox stress, inflammation, neurotransmitter dysregulation, and impaired brain energy metabolism may all be associated with AD pathogenesis. Herein, we explore a possible role for L-arginine (L-arg) in AD, taking into consideration known functions for L-arg in atherosclerosis, redox stress and the inflammatory process, regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, and modulation of glucose metabolism and insulin activity. L-arg, a precursor of nitric oxide and polyamine, exhibits multiple functions in human health and may play a prominent role in age-related degenerative diseases such as AD.},

Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the whole-tumor microvascular architecture. This enormous increase in complexity of image-based data necessitates the application of informatics methods for the analysis, mining and reconstruction of these spatial graph data structures. We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

We perform Bayesian Flux Balance Analysis (BFBA) with a new mathematical model of cellular brain energetics, comprising detailed biochemical pathways in and between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons and partitioning of each cell type into cytosol and mitochondria. Supported by the results of our in silico studies, which are in remarkable agreement with previously published results, we posit the Glucose Shunt Hypothesis (GSH) that during high activity, the inhibition of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme in neuron impairs neuronal glycolysis, enabling the process by which lactate effluxed by astrocytes is taken up by glutamatergic neurons, whereas at low activity, glucose remains the preferred substrate for neurons. We postulate that the ANLS is a shunt utilized by glutamatergic neurons to bypass their glycolysis impaired by the inhibition of PFK in connection with increased oxidative phosphorylation at high neuronal activity.},

As a result, BACE1 has emerged as a prime drug target for reducing the levels of A{\$}\beta{\$} in the AD brain, and the development of BACE1 inhibitors as therapeutic agents is being vigorously pursued. It has proven difficult for the pharmaceutical industry to design BACE1 inhibitor drugs that pass the blood-brain barrier, however this challenge has recently been met and BACE1 inhibitors are now in human clinical trials to test for safety and efficacy in AD patients and individuals with pre-symptomatic AD. Initial results suggest that some of these BACE1 inhibitor drugs are well tolerated, although others have dropped out because of toxicity and it is still too early to know whether any will be effective for the prevention or treatment of AD. Additionally, based on newly identified BACE1 substrates and phenotypes of mice that lack BACE1, concerns have emerged about potential mechanism-based side effects of BACE1 inhibitor drugs with chronic administration. It is hoped that a therapeutic window can be achieved that balances safety and efficacy. This review summarizes the current state of progress in the development of BACE1 inhibitor drugs and the evaluation of their therapeutic potential for AD.},

Using a computer model of an arteriole segment comprised of coupled endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) simulations of both membrane potential and intracellular [Ca(2+)] were performed. The "characteristic" length constant, {\$}\lambda{\$}, was approximated using a modified cable equation in both experiments and simulations. We hypothesized that K(+) conductance in the arteriolar wall limit the electrotonic spread of a local depolarization along arterioles by current dissipation across the VSMC plasma membrane. Thus, we anticipated an increased {\$}\lambda{\$} by inhibition of voltage-activated K(+) channels. Application of the BK(Ca) channel blocker iberiotoxin (100 nM) onto mesenteric arterioles in vitro and inhibition of BK(Ca) channel current in silico increased {\$}\lambda{\$} by 34{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively. Similarly, inhibition of K(V) channels in vitro (4-aminopyridine, 1 mM) or in silico increased {\$}\lambda{\$} by 41{\%} and 21{\%}, respectively. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression of BK(Ca), Kv1.5, Kv2.1, but not Kv1.2, in VSMCs of rat mesenteric terminal arterioles. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of voltage-activated K(+) channels enhance vascular-conducted responses to local depolarization in terminal arterioles by increasing the membrane resistance of VSMCs. These data contribute to our understanding of how differential expression patterns of voltage-activated K(+) channels may influence conducted vasoconstriction in small arteriolar networks. This finding is potentially relevant to understanding the compromised microcirculatory blood flow in systemic vascular diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension.},

Mice which underwent 10 s but not 5 s seizures episode subsequently exhibited significantly increased seizure susceptibility to low doses (equal ED16) of bicuculline (BCC) and {\{}NMDA{\}} during a 3-week observation period. No morphological signs of brain tissue damage were seen in light microscope on the third day after a hypoxia-induced seizure (HS). Learning abilities assessed in passive avoidance test as well as spontaneous alternation were not disturbed after an {\{}HS{\}} episode. Pretreatment with AMPA/KA receptor antagonist {\{}NBQX{\}} effectively prolonged latency to {\{}HS{\}} and given immediately after seizure episode also attenuated subsequent convulsive susceptibility rise, however, {\{}NMDA{\}} receptor antagonist, MK-801, appeared to be ineffective. These results suggest that a seizure episode induced by hypoxia, depending on its duration, may play an epileptogenic role. The AMPA/KA receptor antagonist prolongs the latency to HS, and given after this episode, prevents the long-term epileptogenic effect. },

	Abstract = {We examined the properties of [Ca(2+)](i) changes that were evoked by backpropagating action potentials in pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from the rat. In the presence of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists t-ACPD, DHPG, or CHPG, spikes caused Ca(2+) waves that initiated in the proximal apical dendrites and spread over this region and in the soma. Consistent with previously described synaptic responses (Nakamura et al., 1999a), pharmacological experiments established that the waves were attributable to Ca(2+) release from internal stores mediated by the synergistic effect of receptor-mobilized inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and spike-evoked Ca(2+). The amplitude of the changes reached several micromoles per liter when detected with the low-affinity indicators fura-6F, fura-2-FF, or furaptra. Repetitive brief spike trains at 30-60 sec intervals generated increases of constant amplitude. However, trains at intervals of 10-20 sec evoked smaller increases, suggesting that the stores take 20-30 sec to refill. Release evoked by mGluR agonists was blocked by MCPG, AIDA, 4-CPG, MPEP, and LY367385, a profile consistent with the primacy of group I receptors. At threshold agonist concentrations the release was evoked only in the dendrites; threshold antagonist concentrations were effective only in the soma. Carbachol and 5-HT evoked release with the same spatial distribution as t-ACPD, suggesting that the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors was not responsible for the restricted range of regenerative release. Intracellular BAPTA and EGTA were approximately equally effective in blocking release. Extracellular Cd(2+) blocked release, but no single selective Ca(2+) channel blocker prevented release. These results suggest that IP(3) receptors are not associated closely with specific Ca(2+) channels and are not close to each other.},

	Abstract = {During saccadic motion the eyewall moves in a manner similar to a sinusoid or at least can be represented by a sine Fourier series. Motion of the vitreous is induced by the saccade and the vitreo-retinal interface is subjected to a time-dependent shear. This force may be a significant factor for retinal tearing in the neighbourhood of small retinal holes or tears. An analytical viscoelastic model and a numerical, Newtonian model of the motion of the vitreous are presented and compared. Under sinusoidal boundary motion the analytical model shows that a viscous wave propagates inward toward the axis of rotation and the characteristic length of this wave is a function of the Womersley number. The numerical solution indicates that the vitreous moves similarly to the analytical result with small secondary motion; however, this motion allows complete recirculation of the vitreous over large timescales. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical and numerical models. The time-dependent fluid shear is evaluated and from the analytical solution the maximum value of this is found to be proportional to R0 square root of v(omega)3, where R0 is the eye radius, v the modified complex viscosity and omega the sinusoidal frequency. This indicates that myopes have a larger shear force exerted on them by virtue of the larger eye size. Further work is directed toward a model which links the stress found in the sclera to that exerted on the vitreo-retinal interface by the vitreous fluid motion.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of the medial temporal lobe have primarily made use of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response to neural activity. The interpretation of the BOLD signal as a measure of medial temporal lobe function can be complicated, however, by changes in the cerebrovascular system that can occur with both normal aging and age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Quantitative measures of the functional cerebral blood flow (CBF) response offer a useful complement to BOLD measures and have been shown to aid in the interpretation of fMRI studies. Despite these potential advantages, the application of ASL to fMRI studies of cognitive tasks and at-risk populations has been limited. In this study, we demonstrate the application of ASL fMRI to obtain measures of the CBF and BOLD responses to the encoding of natural scenes in healthy young (mean 25??years) and elderly (mean 74??years) adults. The percent CBF increase in the medial temporal lobe was significantly higher in the older adults, whereas the CBF levels during baseline and task conditions and during a separate resting-state scan were significantly lower in the older group. The older adults also showed slightly higher values for the BOLD response amplitude and the absolute change in CBF, but the age group differences were not significant. The percent CBF and BOLD responses are consistent with an age-related increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) response to memory encoding. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Coupling of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO(2)) in physiologically activated brain states remains the subject of debates. Recently it was suggested that CBF is tightly coupled to oxidative metabolism in a nonlinear fashion. As part of this hypothesis, mathematical models of oxygen delivery to the brain have been described in which disproportionately large increases in CBF are necessary to sustain even small increases in CMRO(2) during activation. We have explored the coupling of CBF and oxygen delivery by using two complementary methods. First, a more complex mathematical model was tested that differs from those recently described in that no assumptions were made regarding tissue oxygen level. Second, [(15)O] water CBF positron emission tomography (PET) studies in nine healthy subjects were conducted during states of visual activation and hypoxia to examine the relationship of CBF and oxygen delivery. In contrast to previous reports, our model showed adequate tissue levels of oxygen could be maintained without the need for increased CBF or oxygen delivery. Similarly, the PET studies demonstrated that the regional increase in CBF during visual activation was not affected by hypoxia. These findings strongly indicate that the increase in CBF associated with physiological activation is regulated by factors other than local requirements in oxygen.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal oscillatory activity is generated by a combination of ionic currents, including at least one inward regenerative current that brings the cell towards depolarized voltages and one outward current that repolarizes the cell. Such currents have traditionally been assumed to require voltage-dependence. Here we test the hypothesis that the voltage dependence of the regenerative inward current is not necessary for generating oscillations. Instead, a current I NL that is linear in the biological voltage range and has negative conductance is sufficient to produce regenerative activity. The current I NL can be considered a linear approximation to the negative-conductance region of the current-voltage relationship of a regenerative inward current. Using a simple conductance-based model, we show that I NL , in conjunction with a voltage-gated, non-inactivating outward current, can generate oscillatory activity. We use phase-plane and bifurcation analyses to uncover a rich variety of behaviors as the conductance of I NL is varied, and show that oscillations emerge as a result of destabilization of the resting state of the model neuron. The model shows the need for well-defined relationships between the inward and outward current conductances, as well as their reversal potentials, in order to produce stable oscillatory activity. Our analysis predicts that a hyperpolarization-activated inward current can play a role in stabilizing oscillatory activity by preventing swings to very negative voltages, which is consistent with what is recorded in biological neurons in general. We confirm this prediction of the model experimentally in neurons from the crab stomatogastric ganglion.},

	Abstract = {Fast excitatory synapses are generally thought to act as private communication channels between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Some recent findings, however, suggest that glutamate may diffuse out of the synaptic cleft and bind to several subtypes of receptors, either in the perisynaptic membrane or at neighboring synapses. it is not known whether activation of these receptors can occur in response to the release of a single vesicle of glutamate. Here we estimate the spatiotemporal profile of glutamate in the extrasynaptic space after vesicle exocytosis, guided by detailed ultrastructural measurements of the CA1 neuropil in the adult rat. We argue that the vicinity of the synapse can be treated as an isotropic porous medium, in which diffusion is determined by the extracellular volume fraction and the tortuosity factor, and develop novel stereological methods to estimate these parameters. We also estimate the spatial separation between synapses, to ask whether glutamate released at one synapse can activate NMDA and other high-affinity receptors at a neighboring synapse. Kinetic simulations of extrasynaptic glutamate uptake show that transporters rapidly reduce the free concentration of transmitter. Exocytosis of a single vesicle is, however, sufficient to bind to high-affinity receptors situated in the immediate perisynaptic space. The distance separating a typical synapse from its nearest neighbor is similar to 465 nm. Whether glutamate can reach a sufficient concentration to activate NMDA receptors at this distance depends critically on the diffusion coefficient in the extracellular space. If diffusion is much slower than in free aqueous solution, NMDA receptors could mediate crosstalk between neighboring synapses.},

	Abstract = {The electrophysiological properties and functional role of GABAergic signal transmission from neurons to the gap junction-coupled astrocytic network are still unclear. GABA-induced astrocytic Cl⁻ flux has been hypothesized to affect the driving force for GABAergic transmission by modulating [Cl⁻]o. Thus, revealing the properties of GABA-mediated astrocytic responses will deepen our understanding of GABAergic signal transmission. Here, we analysed the Cl⁻ dynamics of neurons and astrocytes in CA1 hippocampal GABAergic tripartite synapses, using Cl⁻ imaging during GABA application, and whole cell recordings from interneuron-astrocyte pairs in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Astrocytic [Cl⁻]i was adjusted to physiological conditions (40 mm). Although GABA application evoked bidirectional Cl⁻ flux via GABAA receptors and mouse GABA transporter 4 (mGAT4) in CA1 astrocytes, a train of interneuron firing induced only GABAA receptor-mediated inward currents in an adjacent astrocyte. A GAT1 inhibitor increased the interneuron firing-induced currents and induced bicuculline-insensitive, mGAT4 inhibitor-sensitive currents, suggesting that synaptic spillover of GABA predominantly induced the astrocytic Cl⁻ efflux because GABAA receptors are localized near the synaptic clefts. This GABA-induced Cl⁻ efflux was accompanied by Cl⁻ siphoning via the gap junctions of the astrocytic network because gap junction inhibitors significantly reduced the interneuron firing-induced currents. Thus, Cl⁻ efflux from astrocytes is homeostatically maintained within astrocytic networks. A gap junction inhibitor enhanced the activity-dependent depolarizing shifts of reversal potential of neuronal IPSCs evoked by repetitive stimulation to GABAergic synapses. These results suggest that Cl⁻ conductance within the astrocytic network may contribute to maintaining GABAergic synaptic transmission by regulating [Cl⁻]o.},

Each new terminal segment is connected to the optimum site within the preexisting tree, and the new bifurcation is optimized geometrically. After each step of adding and optimizing, the whole tree is rescaled to meet invariant boundary conditions of pressure and flow at each terminal site. Thus, local geometric optimization is used to induce simultaneously an optimized global structure. The comparison between the model and real coronary arterial trees shows good agreement regarding structural appearance, morphometric parameters, and pressure profiles.},

	Abstract = {The prevalence of diabetes, a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, is increasing rapidly worldwide. According to the world health organization (WHO), almost 422 million people in the world have diabetes. Vascular dysfunction, that is distinctively observed in diabetic patients, also leads to the high chance of cardiovascular diseases. The cellular mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in diabetes are not completely elucidated because of the high-level complexity involved. There are some recent studies in literature about the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction associated with diabetes. These studies imply that the dysfunction of diabetic VSMC is related to the alterations of functions of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and calcium handling proteins such as sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), and ryanodine receptor (RyR). The main purpose of the thesis is to explore the importance of SERCA, IP3R, RyR and GJIC as modulating factors of intracellular calcium  Ca2+ cyt  dynamics in VSMCs and investigate the related consequences in the perspective of diabetes. As a powerful tool to investigate extremely complex biological systems, we have developed a mathematical model of VSMC to accomplish our research aims. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was modelled as a single luminally continuous store with homogeneous luminal calcium. None of the VSMC mathematical models has used sequential binding of calcium and IP3 for the activation of IP3R. As calcium is the central attention of the study, we have incorporated a simplified 4-state sequential-binding IP3R model. The change of SERCA, IP3R or RyR level shifted the oscillatory state of intracellular calcium to steady and vice versa at a constant agonist concentration. Especially, increasing SERCA level move the oscillatory region to high agonist concentrations whereas increasing IP3R or RyR level shift the oscillatory region to lower agonist concentrations. The shift of oscillatory region was significant at low SERCA levels and at low IP3 levels. The model results indicate that using the same agonist concentration for studying the existence of intracellular concentrations in the absence of IP3R or RyR may lead to contradictory findings because of the shift of oscillatory region. The model results showed that Vm-mediated signalling mechanism plays dominant role in the propagation of calcium rise whereas the activation of IP3R acts as a limiting step tomake the IP3-mediated calcium propagation ineffective. It seems that the penetration depth and the wave velocity of intracellular calcium oscillations in coupled VSMCs are strongly related to the GJIC if the regenerative propagation was not extended to all the non-stimulated cells. The downregulation of IP3R and RyR reduced the penetration of intracellular calcium propagation in VSMCs. The SERCA regulation of the frequency of intracellular calcium oscillations and penetration of regenerative propagation are biphasic. Based on the model results, our hypothesis is that if an external environment influences the agonist-induced calcium transients, the VSMC may alter the levels of SERCA, IP3R and/or RyR expressed in the SR to restore intracellular calcium transients matched with the functional need. The reduced SERCA level is a possible mechanism for the ``smoothed" calcium transients in diabetic VSMCs. The SERCA level tends to be the regulating factor of intracellular calcium in both the activation and relaxation phases of oscillations. Also, the model results indicate that the functional changes due to altered level of IP3R in diabetic VSMCs might be regulated by altering the level of the RyR protein and vice versa. However, the impaired intracellular calcium dynamics due to reduced SERCA levels can not be restored by changing IP3R or RyR levels because of the reduced intra-SR calcium load. These findings lead to the fact that reduced SERCA level is probably the primary factor responsible for the reduced intracellular calcium transients and the reduced contractility in diabetic VSMCs even though all the three proteins, SERCA, IP3R and RyR, are varied.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a cascade of pathological events involving formation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques and tau-based neurofibrillary tangles, changes in brain structure and function, and eventually, cognitive impairment and functional disability. The precise sequence of when each of these disease markers becomes abnormal is not yet clearly understood. The present study systematically tested the relationship between classes of biomarkers according to a proposed model of temporal sequence by Jack et al. (Lancet Neurology 9:119-128, 2010). We examined temporal relations among four classes of biomarkers: CSF A{\$}\beta{\$}, CSF tau, neuroimaging variables (hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, FDG PET), and cognitive variables (memory and executive function). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to test hypotheses that putative earlier markers of AD predicted change in later markers, and that intervening markers reduced effects of earlier on later markers. Specifically, we hypothesized that CSF tau would explain CSF A{\$}\beta{\$}'s relation to neuroimaging and cognitive variables, and neuroimaging variables would explain tau's relation to cognitive variables. Consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that CSF A{\$}\beta{\$} effects on cognition change were substantially attenuated by CSF tau and measures of brain structure and function, and CSF tau effects on cognitive change were attenuated by neuroimaging variables. Contrary to hypotheses, CSF A{\$}\beta{\$} and CSF tau were observed to have independent effects on neuroimaging and CSF tau had a direct effect on baseline cognition independent of brain structure and function. These results have implications for clarifying the temporal sequence of AD changes and corresponding biomarkers.},

	Abstract = {Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is dually acylated by N-myristoylation and cysteine palmitoylation and resides in Golgi and caveolae membranes. N-Myristoylation is necessary for its membrane association and targeting into the Golgi complex of transfected cells whereas palmitoylation influences the targeting of eNOS into caveolae. However, the in vivo significance of palmitoylation, membrane association, and the corresponding caveolar localization of eNOS have not been shown. To further examine the nature of membrane association of palmitoylation-deficient forms of eNOS and to address the functional role(s) of palmitoylation in activation of eNOS in vivo, HEk 293 cells stably transfected with wild-type (WT) or palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS were generated. Membrane association of the mutants was biochemically similar to that of the WT protein in terms of their resistance to high salt, high pH, and distribution between Triton X-114 detergent and aqueous phases, suggesting that other hydrophobic factor (s) in eNOS most likely contribute to its membrane association. Most importantly, palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS released less NO from the cells than did WT enzyme, suggesting that palmitoylation plays an important role in determining the optimal release of NO from intact cells. The diminished release of NO from the palmitoylation-deficient mutants was not attributable to alterations in its catalytic properties as the purified mutant and WT enzymes were kinetically identical. Since palmitoylation is necessary for localization of eNOS in caveolae, our data suggest that such localization could regulate the frequency and magnitude of NO release in response to stimuli in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing and remitting conditions associated with long-term gut dysfunction resulting from alterations to the enteric nervous system and a loss of enteric neurons. The mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced enteric neuron death are unknown. Here using in vivo models of experimental colitis we report that inflammation causes enteric neuron death by activating a neuronal signaling complex composed of P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs), pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels, the Asc adaptor protein and caspases. Inhibition of P2X7R, Panx1, Asc or caspase activity prevented inflammation-induced neuron cell death. Preservation of enteric neurons by inhibiting Panx1 in vivo prevented the onset of inflammation-induced colonic motor dysfunction. Panx1 expression was reduced in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis. We conclude that activation of neuronal Panx1 underlies neuron death and the subsequent development of abnormal gut motility in IBD. Targeting Panx1 represents a new neuroprotective strategy to ameliorate the progression of IBD-associated dysmotility.},

	Abstract = {Coupling between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was studied using multiple sequential administrations of 15O-labeled radiotracers (half-life, 123 sec) and positron emission tomography. In the resting state an excellent correlation (mean r, 0.87) between CBF and CMRO2 was found when paired measurements of CBF and CMRO2 from multiple (30-48) brain regions were tested in each of 33 normal subjects. Regional uncoupling of CBF and CMRO2 was found, however, during neuronal activation induced by somatosensory stimulation. Stimulus-induced focal augmentation of cerebral blood flow (29{\%} mean) far exceeded the concomitant local increase in tissue metabolic rate (mean, 5{\%}), when resting-state and stimulated-state measurements were obtained in each of 9 subjects. Stimulus duration had no significant effect on response magnitude or on the degree of CBF-CMRO2 uncoupling observed. Dynamic, physiological regulation of CBF by a mechanism (neuronal or biochemical) dependent on neuronal firing per se, but independent of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, is hypothesized.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes are considered the third component of the synapse, responding to neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals and releasing gliotransmitters--including glutamate--in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to affect neuronal synaptic activity. Many studies reporting astrocyte-driven neuronal activity have evoked astrocyte Ca(2+) increases by application of endogenous ligands that directly activate neuronal receptors, making astrocyte contribution to neuronal effect(s) difficult to determine. We have made transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor only in astrocytes to evoke astrocyte Ca(2+) increases using an agonist that does not bind endogenous receptors in brain. By recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from these mice, we demonstrate that widespread Ca(2+) elevations in 80{\%}-90{\%} of stratum radiatum astrocytes do not increase neuronal Ca(2+), produce neuronal slow inward currents, or affect excitatory synaptic activity. Our findings call into question the developing consensus that Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in situ.},

	Abstract = {Continuous cerebral blood flow is essential for neuronal survival, but whether vascular tone influences resting neuronal function is not known. Using a multidisciplinary approach in both rat and mice brain slices, we determined if flow/pressure-evoked increases or decreases in parenchymal arteriole vascular tone which result in arteriole constriction and dilation, respectively altered resting cortical pyramidal neuron activity. We present evidence for intercellular communication in the brain involving a flow of information from vessel-to-astrocyte-to neuron, a direction opposite to that of classic neurovascular coupling and referred here as vasculo-neuronal coupling (VNC). Flow/pressure increases within parenchymal arterioles increased vascular tone and simultaneously decreased resting pyramidal neuron firing activity. On the other hand, flow/pressure decreases evoke parenchymal arteriole dilation and increased resting pyramidal neuron firing activity. In GLAST-CreERT2; R26-lsl-GCaMP3 mice we demonstrate that increased parenchymal arteriole tone significantly increased intracellular calcium in perivascular astrocyte processes, the onset of astrocyte calcium changes preceded the inhibition of cortical pyramidal neuronal firing activity. During increases in parenchymal arteriole tone, the pyramidal neuron response was unaffected by blockers of nitric oxide, GABAA, glutamate or ecto-ATPase. However, VNC was abrogated by TRPV4 channel, GABAB, as well as an adenosine A1 receptor blocker. Differently to pyramidal neuron responses, increases in flow/pressure within parenchymal arterioles increased the firing activity of a subtype of interneuron. Taken together, these data suggest that VNC is a complex constitutive active process that enables neurons to efficiently adjust their resting activity according to brain perfusion levels, thus safeguarding cellular homeostasis by preventing mismatches between energy supply and demand. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTS We present evidence for vessel-to-neuron communication in the brain slice defined here as vasculo-neuronal coupling. We showed that in response to increases in parenchymal arteriole tone astrocyte intracellular Ca(2+) increased and cortical neuronal activity decreased. On the other hand, decreasing parenchymal arteriole tone increased resting cortical pyramidal neuron activity. Vasculo-neuronal coupling was partly mediated by TRPV4 channels as genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade impaired increased flow/pressure-evoked neuronal inhibition. Increased flow/pressure-evoked neuronal inhibition was blocked in the presence of adenosine A1 receptor and GABAB receptor blockade. Results provide evidence for the concept of vasculo-neuronal coupling and highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between basal CBF and resting neuronal activity.},

	Abstract = {The oscillatory shear index (OSI) was developed based on the hypothesis that intimal hyperplasia was correlated with oscillatory shear stresses. However, the validity of the OSI was in question since the correlation between intimal thickness and the OSI at the side walls of the sinus in the Y-shaped model of the average human carotid bifurcation (Y-AHCB) was weak. The objectives of this paper are to examine whether the reason for the weak correlation lies in the deviation in geometry of Y-AHCB from real human carotid bifurcation, and whether this correlation is clearly improved in the tuning-fork-shaped model of the average human carotid bifurcation (TF-AHCB). The geometry of the TF-AHCB model was based on observation and statistical analysis of specimens from 74 cadavers. The flow fields in both models were studied and compared by using flow visualization methods under steady flow conditions and by using laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) under pulsatile flow conditions. The TF-shaped geometry leads to a more complex flow field than the Y-shaped geometry. This added complexity includes strengthened helical movements in the sinus, new flow separation zone, and directional changes in the secondary flow patterns. The results show that the OSI-values at the side walls of the sinus in the TF-shaped model were more than two times as large as those in the Y-shaped model. This study confirmed the stronger correlation between the OSI and intimal thickness in the tuning-fork geometry of human carotid bifurcation, and the TF-AHCB model is a significant improvement over the traditional Y-shaped model.

	Abstract = {Lipid messengers and amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides generated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and presenilin-1 (PS1) mediate pro-inflammatory signaling and neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. This study provides data showing that the COX-2 and PS1 genes each transcribe rare, highly labile RNA species that display early response gene behavior in human neural (HN) cells in primary culture, down-regulation during human neural development, and up-regulation in AD neocortex and hippocampal CA1. Together, interleukin-1beta and amyloid beta42 peptide [IL-1beta+Abeta42] synergistically activated COX-2 and PS1 gene expression preceded by increases in AP1-, STAT1alpha-, and in particular NF-kappaBp50/p65- and HIF-1alpha-DNA binding. These events were markedly potentiated by hypoxia and blocked by the antioxidant alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone. Broad transcription profiling further indicated that hypoxia-induced, [IL-1beta+Abeta42]-treated HN cells display robust induction of COX-2 and PS1 as well as a pro-inflammatory gene family that includes NF-kappaBp50/p105, IL-1beta precursor, and cytosolic phospholipase A2 genes. These findings indicate a novel [IL-1beta+Abeta42]-mediated, hypoxia-enhanced, free radical-triggered gene program that drives inflammatory gene signaling and suggest a mechanism by which hypoxia during aging contributes episodically to amyloidogenesis, inflammation, and AD pathophysiology.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a minimum kinetic model for cross-bridge interactions with the thin filament in smooth muscle. The model hypothesizes two types of cross-bridge interactions: 1) cycling phosphorylated cross bridges and 2) noncycling dephosphorylated cross bridges ("latch bridges"). The major assumptions are that 1) Ca2+-dependent myosin phosphorylation is the only postulated regulatory mechanism, 2) each myosin head acts independently, and 3) latch bridges are formed by dephosphorylation of an attached cross bridge. Rate constants were resolved by fitting data on the time courses of myosin phosphorylation and stress development. Comparison of the rate constants indicates that latch-bridge detachment is the rate-limiting step. Model simulations predicted a hyperbolic dependence of steady-state stress on myosin phosphorylation, which corresponded with the experimental observation of high values of stress with low levels of phosphorylation in intact tissues. Model simulations also predicted the experimental observation that an initial phosphorylation transient only accelerates stress development, with no effect on the final steady-state levels of stress. Because the only Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism in this model was activation of myosin light chain kinase, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that myosin phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for the development of the latch state.},

	Abstract = {The occlusion of arteries during ischaemia causes a state of insufficient blood supply and hypoperfusion downstream to keep the brain functioning. Hypoperfusion in the human brain is a critical event which leads to cerebral hypoxia with a high risk of developing impairment. Vasomotion can be induced in the situation of reduced perfusion. This might increase the blood flow by decreasing the effective vascular resistance and lead to enhanced perfusion. Therefore, one could assume that vasomotion is a regulating mechanism associated with hypoperfusion to control vascular resistance, blood flow and tissue perfusion. It is therefore important to explore the underlying mechanisms and the factors affecting the initiation and spread of vasomotion. In future, this study could help the early diagnosis and treatment of previously mentioned pathological conditions. The study analyses the minimum condition required to initiate vasomotion. It is shown that a minimum number of cells need to be stimulated with a sufficient amount of depolarization to initiate the conduction of contraction.},

	Abstract = {Endothelial cells have common as well as specialized roles in different tissues and organs; as such, the abundant endothelial cells in the corpus luteum ({\textgreater} 50{\%} of total cell population) could have unique activities necessary for luteal function. Our objective was to establish a method for isolating a pure population of endothelial cells from the primate corpus luteum and to determine the basic conditions for in vitro culture. Corpora lutea collected from rhesus monkeys throughout the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle were minced and enzymatically dispersed into single cell suspensions. Endothelial cells were isolated from the remaining cells (i.e., steroidogenic, fibroblastic, etc.) utilizing magnetic beads labeled with a lectin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1), which binds a sugar found only on primate endothelial cells. After exposure to a magnetic field, UEA-1-negative (-) cells were decanted from the pelleted UEA-1-positive (+) cells; to remove beads from the UEA-1 (+) cells, excess sugar was applied. After optimization of the bead-to-cell ratio, the UEA-1 (+) group contained a population of cells 8-12 microns in diameter (typical endothelial cell size) and {\textless} 1{\%} steroidogenic cells. UEA-1 (-) cells were larger (15-35 microns) and stained histochemically for the steroidogenic marker, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that {\textgreater} 93{\%} of all cells in the UEA-1 (+) group stained positive for the specific endothelial cell marker, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1. Cultured UEA-1 (+) cells produced low levels of progesterone and were unresponsive to hCG (100 ng/ml). In contrast, cultured UEA-1 (-) and mixed (unsorted) cells produced high basal levels of progesterone and exhibited a {\textgreater} 3-fold increase in response to hCG treatment. Preliminary experiments comparing different culture media and matrices demonstrated that 1) cell proliferation was unaffected by type of medium (i.e., Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium [DMEM]/ F12 or McCoy's 5A); 2) the presence of serum was essential in the absence of added growth factors, and 3) extracellular matrix had a profound effect on proliferation. UEA-1 (+) cells exhibited a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the presence and absence of fetal calf serum. In the absence of serum, VEGF stimulated proliferation of UEA-1 (+) cells plated on fibronectin but not collagen I, whereas in the presence of 10{\%} fetal calf serum, both matrices supported VEGF-induced mitogenesis. These studies provide for the first time an efficient, reliable method for isolating primate luteal endothelial cells and describe in vitro culture conditions for subsequent studies examining luteal endothelial cell function and regulation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-term habituation of the startle response represents an elementary form of learning in mammals. The underlying mechanism is located within the primary startle pathway, presumably at sensory synapses on giant neurons in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC). Short trains of action potentials in sensory afferent fibers induce depression of synaptic responses in PnC giant neurons, a phenomenon that has been proposed to be the cellular correlate for short-term habituation. We address here the question whether both this synaptic depression and the short-term habituation of the startle response are localized at the presynaptic terminals of sensory afferents. If this is confirmed, it would imply that these processes take place prior to multimodal signal integration, rather than occurring at postsynaptic sites on PnC giant neurons that directly drive motor neurons.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: Patch-clamp recordings in vitro were combined with behavioral experiments; synaptic depression was specific for the input pathway stimulated and did not affect signals elicited by other sensory afferents. Concordant with this, short-term habituation of the acoustic startle response in behavioral experiments did not influence tactile startle response amplitudes and vice versa. Further electrophysiological analysis showed that the passive properties of the postsynaptic neuron were unchanged but revealed some alterations in short-term plasticity during depression. Moreover, depression was induced only by trains of presynaptic action potentials and not by single pulses. There was no evidence for transmitter receptor desensitization. In summary, the data indicates that the synaptic depression mechanism is located presynaptically.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: Our electrophysiological and behavioral data strongly indicate that synaptic depression in the PnC as well as short-term habituation are located in the sensory part of the startle pathway, namely at the axon terminals of sensory afferents in the PnC. Our results further corroborate the link between synaptic depression and short-term habituation of the startle response.},

	Abstract = {Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid that are produced by the vascular endothelium in responses to various stimuli such as the agonists acetylcholine (ACH) or bradykinin or by shear stress which activates phospholipase A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} to release arachidonic acid. EETs are important regulators of vascular tone and homeostasis. In the modulation of vascular tone, EETs function as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs). In models of vascular inflammation, EETs attenuate inflammatory signaling pathways in both the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. Likewise, EETs regulate blood vessel formation or angiogenesis by mechanisms that are still not completely understood. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) converts EETs to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) and this metabolism limits many of the biological actions of EETs. The recent development of inhibitors of sEH provides an emerging target for pharmacological manipulation of EETs. Additionally, EETs may initiate their biological effects by interacting with a cell surface protein that is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Since GPCRs represent a common target of most drugs, further characterization of the EET receptor and synthesis of specific EET agonists and antagonist can be used to exploit many of the beneficial effects of EETs in vascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. This review will focus on the current understanding of the contribution of EETs to the regulation of vascular tone, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of targeting the EET pathway in vascular disease will be highlighted. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {The term cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) describes a wave of mass neuronal depolarization associated with net influx of cations and water. Clusters of prolonged CSDs were measured time-locked to progressive ischaemic damage in human cortex. CSD induces tone alterations in resistance vessels, causing either transient hyperperfusion (physiological haemodynamic response) in healthy tissue; or hypoperfusion [inverse haemodynamic response = cortical spreading ischaemia (CSI)] in tissue at risk for progressive damage, which has so far only been shown experimentally. Here, we performed a prospective, multicentre study in 13 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, using novel subdural opto-electrode technology for simultaneous laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and direct current-electrocorticography, combined with measurements of tissue partial pressure of oxygen (ptiO(2)). Regional cerebral blood flow and electrocorticography were simultaneously recorded in 417 CSDs. Isolated CSDs occurred in 12 patients and were associated with either physiological, absent or inverse haemodynamic responses. Whereas the physiological haemodynamic response caused tissue hyperoxia, the inverse response led to tissue hypoxia. Clusters of prolonged CSDs were measured in five patients in close proximity to structural brain damage as assessed by neuroimaging. Clusters were associated with CSD-induced spreading hypoperfusions, which were significantly longer in duration (up to 144 min) than those of isolated CSDs. Thus, oxygen depletion caused by the inverse haemodynamic response may contribute to the establishment of clusters of prolonged CSDs and lesion progression. Combined electrocorticography and perfusion monitoring also revealed a characteristic vascular signature that might be used for non-invasive detection of CSD. Low-frequency vascular fluctuations (LF-VF) (f {\textless}0.1 Hz), detectable by functional imaging methods, are determined by the brain's resting neuronal activity. CSD provides a depolarization block of the resting activity, recorded electrophysiologically as spreading depression of high-frequency-electrocorticography activity. Accordingly, we observed a spreading suppression of LF-VF, which accompanied spreading depression of high-frequency-electrocorticography activity, independently of whether CSD was associated with a physiological, absent or inverse haemodynamic response. Spreading suppressions of LF-VF thus allow the differentiation of progressive ischaemia and repair phases in a fashion similar to that shown previously for spreading depressions of high-frequency-electrocorticography activity. In conclusion, it is suggested that (i) CSI is a novel human disease mechanism associated with lesion development and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stroke; and that (ii) prolonged spreading suppressions of LF-VF are a novel 'functional marker' for progressive ischaemia.},

	Abstract = {The classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model neglects the time-dependence of ion concentrations in spiking dynamics. The dynamics is therefore limited to a time scale of milliseconds, which is determined by the membrane capacitance multiplied by the resistance of the ion channels, and by the gating time constants. We study slow dynamics in an extended HH framework that includes time-dependent ion concentrations, pumps, and buffers. Fluxes across the neuronal membrane change intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, whereby the latter can also change through contact to reservoirs in the surroundings. Ion gain and loss of the system is identified as a bifurcation parameter whose essential importance was not realized in earlier studies. Our systematic study of the bifurcation structure and thus the phase space structure helps to understand activation and inhibition of a new excitability in ion homeostasis which emerges in such extended models. Also modulatory mechanisms that regulate the spiking rate can be explained by bifurcations. The dynamics on three distinct slow times scales is determined by the cell volume-to-surface-area ratio and the membrane permeability (seconds), the buffer time constants (tens of seconds), and the slower backward buffering (minutes to hours). The modulatory dynamics and the newly emerging excitable dynamics corresponds to pathological conditions observed in epileptiform burst activity, and spreading depression in migraine aura and stroke, respectively.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that Ca(2+) responses to GPCR activation are coordinated between neighboring ECs of resistance arteries. METHODS: EC tubes were freshly isolated from superior epigastric arteries of C57BL/6 mice. Intercellular coupling was tested using microinjection of propidium iodide. Following loading with fluo-4 dye, intracellular Ca(2+) responses to ACh were imaged with confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Cell-to-cell transfer of propidium iodide confirmed functional GJCs. A 1 {\$}\mu{\$}m ACh stimulus evoked Ca(2+) responses (9.8 $\pm$ 0.8/min, F/F(0) = 3.11 $\pm$ 0.2) which pseudo-line-scan analysis revealed as composed of Ca(2+) waves and spatially restricted Ca(2+) release events. A 100 nm ACh stimulus induced Ca(2+) responses of lower frequency (4.5 $\pm$ 0.7/min) and amplitude (F/F(0) = 1.95 $\pm$ 0.11) composed primarily of spatially restricted events. The time interval between Ca(2+) waves in adjacent cells (0.79 $\pm$ 0.12 s) was shorter (p {\textless}0.05) than that between nonadjacent cells (1.56 $\pm$ 0.25 s). Spatially restricted Ca(2+) release events had similar frequencies and latencies between adjacent and nonadjacent cells. Inhibiting intracellular Ca(2+) release with 2-APB, Xestospongin C or thapsigargin eliminated Ca(2+) responses. CONCLUSIONS: With moderate GPCR stimulation, localized Ca(2+) release events predominate among cells. Greater GPCR stimulation evokes coordinated intercellular Ca(2+) waves via the ER. Calcium signaling during GPCR activation is complex among cells, varying with stimulus intensity and proximity to actively signaling cells.},

	Abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD), abnormal accumulations of beta-amyloid are present in the brain and degenerating neurons exhibit cytoskeletal aberrations (neurofibrillary tangles). Roles for beta-amyloid in the neuronal degeneration of AD have been suggested based on recent data obtained in rodent studies demonstrating neurotoxic actions of beta-amyloid. However, the cellular mechanism of action of beta-amyloid is unknown, and there is no direct information concerning the biological activity of beta-amyloid in human neurons. We now report on experiments in human cerebral cortical cell cultures that tested the hypothesis that beta-amyloid can destabilize neuronal calcium regulation and render neurons more vulnerable to environmental stimuli that elevate intracellular calcium levels. Synthetic beta-amyloid peptides (beta APs) corresponding to amino acids 1-38 or 25-35 of the beta-amyloid protein enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity in cortical cultures, while a peptide with a scrambled sequence was without effect. beta APs alone had no effect on neuronal survival during a 4 d exposure period. beta APs enhanced both kainate and NMDA neurotoxicity, indicating that the effect was not specific for a particular subtype of glutamate receptor. The effects of beta APs on excitatory amino acid (EAA)-induced neuronal degeneration were concentration dependent and required prolonged (days) exposures. The beta APs also rendered neurons more vulnerable to calcium ionophore neurotoxicity, indicating that beta APs compromised the ability of the neurons to reduce intracellular calcium levels to normal limits. Direct measurements of intracellular calcium levels demonstrated that beta APs elevated rest levels of calcium and enhanced calcium responses to EAAs and calcium ionophore. The neurotoxicity caused by EAAs and potentiated by beta APs was dependent upon calcium influx since it did not occur in calcium-deficient culture medium. Finally, the beta APs made neurons more vulnerable to neurofibrillary tangle-like antigenic changes induced by EAAs or calcium ionophore (i.e., increased staining with tau and ubiquitin antibodies). Taken together, these data suggest that beta-amyloid destabilizes neuronal calcium homeostasis and thereby renders neurons more vulnerable to environmental insults.},

	Abstract = {An important concept that has not been sufficiently represented in research into neurodegenerative diseases1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 is the role of the neurovascular unit. The neurovascular unit comprises neurons and non-neuronal cells such as vascular cells (endothelia, pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) and glia (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendroglia), which could have major roles in disease pathogenesis. These non-neuronal cells form the anatomical, biochemical and immune blood-brain barriers (BBBs) of the CNS and maintain the chemical and cellular composition of the neuronal 'milieu', which is required for proper functioning of neuronal synapses and circuits and for remodeling, angiogenesis and neurogenesis.  A key concern is how we should study neurodegenerative disorders using animal models3. Genetically engineered models of human neurodegenerative disorders in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have been useful for dissecting basic disease mechanisms and screening compounds. However, in addition to having much simpler nervous systems, non-mammalian species have cerebrovascular and immune systems that differ substantially from those of humans. For instance, the BBB in insects is between the hemolymph and glial cells, and worms do not have a cardiovascular system or BBB. So, genetic models of human diseases in non-mammalian species might not replicate the spectrum of disease pathology found in mammals.},

	Abstract = {Historically, the neuron has been the conceptual focus for almost all of neuroscience research. In recent years, however, the concept of the neurovascular unit has emerged as a new paradigm for investigating both physiology and pathology in the CNS. This concept proposes that a purely neurocentric focus is not sufficient, and emphasizes that all cell types in the brain including neuronal, glial and vascular components, must be examined in an integrated context. Cell-cell signaling and coupling between these different compartments form the basis for normal function. Disordered signaling and perturbed coupling form the basis for dysfunction and disease. In this mini-review, we will survey four examples of this phenomenon: hemodynamic neurovascular coupling linking blood flow to brain activity; cellular communications that evoke the blood-brain barrier phenotype; parallel systems that underlie both neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the CNS; and finally, the potential exchange of trophic factors that may link neuronal, glial and vascular homeostasis.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques in which the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to a neural stimulus are measured, can be used to estimate the fractional increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) that accompanies evoked neural activity. A measure of neurovascular coupling is obtained from the ratio of fractional CBF and CMRO2 responses, defined as n, with the implicit assumption that relative rather than absolute changes in CBF and CMRO2 adequately characterise the flow-metabolism response to neural activity. The coupling parameter n is important in terms of its effect on the BOLD response, and as potential insight into the flow-metabolism relationship in both normal and pathological brain function. In 10 healthy human subjects, BOLD and CBF responses were measured to test the effect of baseline perfusion (modulated by a hypercapnia challenge) on the coupling parameter n during graded visual stimulation. A dual-echo pulsed arterial spin labelling (PASL) sequence provided absolute quantification of CBF in baseline and active states as well as relative BOLD signal changes, which were used to estimate CMRO2 responses to the graded visual stimulus. The absolute CBF response to the visual stimuli were constant across different baseline CBF levels, meaning the fractional CBF responses were reduced at the hyperperfused baseline state. For the graded visual stimuli, values of n were significantly reduced during hypercapnia induced hyperperfusion. Assuming the evoked neural responses to the visual stimuli are the same for both baseline CBF states, this result has implications for fMRI studies that aim to measure neurovascular coupling using relative changes in CBF. The coupling parameter n is sensitive to baseline CBF, which would confound its interpretation in fMRI studies where there may be significant differences in baseline perfusion between groups. The absolute change in CBF, as opposed to the change relative to baseline, may more closely match the underlying increase in neural activity in response to a stimulus.},

	Abstract = {Abstract-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are cytochrome P450-derived metabolites of arachidonic acid. They are potent endogenous vasodilator compounds produced by vascular cells, and EET-induced vasodilation has been attributed to activation of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) K+ channels. However, in some cells, EETs activate Ca2+ channels, resulting in Ca2+ influx and increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Ca2+i). We investigated whether EETs also can activate Ca2+ channels in vascular SMC and whether the resultant Ca2+ influx can influence vascular tone. The 4 EET regioisomers (1 micromol/L) increased porcine aortic SMC Ca2+i by 52{\%} to 81{\%}, whereas arachidonic acid, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (1 micromol/L) produced little effect. The increases in Ca2+i produced by 14,15-EET were abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+ and by pretreatment with verapamil (10 micromol/L), an inhibitor of voltage-dependent (L-type) Ca2+ channels. 14,15-EET did not alter Ca2+ signaling induced by norepinephrine and thapsigargin. When administered to porcine coronary artery rings precontracted with a thromboxane mimetic, 14,15-EET produced relaxation. However, when administered to rings precontracted with acetylcholine or KCl, 14,15-EET produced additional contractions. In rings exposed to 10 mmol/L KCl, a concentration that did not affect resting ring tension, 14,15-EET produced small contractions that were abolished by EGTA (3 mmol/L) or verapamil (10 micromol/L). These observations indicate that 14,15-EET enhances Ca2+i influx in vascular SMC through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. This 14,15-EET-induced increase in Cai2+ can produce vasoconstriction and therefore may act to modulate EET-induced vasorelaxation},

Are these cells only filling up the space and passively nurturing the neurons, or do they also contribute to information transfer and processing? After several years of intense research since the pioneer discovery of astrocytic calcium waves and glutamate release onto neurons in vitro, the neuronal-glial studies have answered many questions thanks to technological advances. However, the definitive in vivo role of astrocytes remains to be addressed. In addition, it is becoming clear that diverse populations of astrocytes coexist with different molecular identities and specialized functions adjusted to their microenvironment, but do they all belong to the umbrella family of astrocytes? One population of astrocytes takes on a new function by displaying both support cell and stem cell characteristics in the neurogenic niches. Here, we define characteristics that classify a cell as an astrocyte under physiological conditions. We will also discuss the well-established and emerging functions of astrocytes with an emphasis on their roles on neuronal activity and as neural stem cells in adult neurogenic zones. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {In case of traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurrence of central nervous tissue damage is frequently aligned with local modulations of neuronal and glial gap junction channel expression levels. The degree of gap junctional protein expression and intercellular coupling efficiency, as well as hemichannel function has substantially impact on the course of trauma recovery and outcome. During TBI, gap junctions are especially involved in the intercellular molecule trafficking on repair of blood vessels and the regulation of vasomotor tone. Furthermore, gliosis and astrocytic swelling due to mechanical strain injury point out the consequences of derailed gap junction communication. This review addresses the outstanding role of gap junction channels in TBI pathophysiology and links the current state of results to applied clinical procedures as well as perspectives in acute and long-term treatment options.},

	Abstract = {Complex patterns of intercellular calcium signaling occur in the CA1 and CA2 regions of hippocampal slice organotypic cultures from neonatal mice. Spontaneous localized intercellular Ca2+ waves involving 5-15 cells propagate concentrically from multiple foci in the stratum oriens and s. radiatum. In these same regions, extensive Ca2+ waves involving hundreds of cells propagate as curvilinear and spiral wavefronts across broad areas of CA1 and CA2. Ca2+ waves travel at rates of 5-10 mu m/s, are abolished by thapsigargin, and do not require extracellular Ca2+. Staining for astrocytes and neurons indicates that these intercellular waves occur primarily in astrocytes. The frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ waves increase in response to bath application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and decrease in response to removal of extracellular Ca2+ or application of tetrodotoxin. This novel pattern of intercellular Ca2+ signaling is characteristic of the behavior of an excitable medium. Networks of glial cells in the hippocampus may behave as an excitable medium whose spatial and temporal signaling properties are modulated by neuronal activity.},

	Abstract = {Gap junction coupling enables astrocytes to form large networks. Its strength determines how easily a signalling molecule diffuses through the network and how far a locally initiated signal can spread. Changes of coupling strength are well-documented during development and in response to various stimuli. Precise quantification of coupling is needed for studying such modifications and their functional consequences. We therefore explored spatial properties of astrocyte coupling in a model simulating dye loading of single astrocytes. Dye spread into the astrocyte network could be characterized by a coupling length constant and coupling anisotropy. In experiments, the fluorescent marker Alexa Fluor 594 was used to measure these parameters in CA1 and dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus. Coupling did not differ between regions but showed a temperature-dependence, partially owing to changes of intracellular diffusivity, detected by measuring coupling length constants but not the more variable cell counts of dye-coupled astrocytes. We further found that coupling is anisotropic depending on distance to the pyramidal cell layer, which correlated with regional differences of astrocyte morphology. This demonstrates that applying these new analytical approaches provides useful quantitative information on gap junction coupling and its heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {ACh and KCl stimulate vasomotor responses that spread rapidly and bidirectionally along arteriole walls, most likely via spread of electric current or Ca2+ through gap junctions. We examined these possibilities with isolated, cannulated, and perfused hamster cheek pouch arterioles (50- to 80-microm resting diameter). After intraluminal loading of 2 microM fluo 3 to measure Ca2+ or 1 microM di-8-ANEPPS to measure membrane potential, photometric techniques were used to selectively measure changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) or membrane potential in endothelial cells. Activation of the endothelium by micropipette application of ACh (10-4 M, 1.0-s pulse) to a short segment of arteriole (100-200 microm) increased endothelial cell [Ca2+]i and caused hyperpolarization at the site of stimulation. This response was followed rapidly by vasodilation of the entire arteriole ( approximately 2-mm length). Change in membrane potential always preceded dilation, both at the site of stimulation and at distant sites along the arteriole. In contrast, an increase in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i was observed only at the application site. Micropipette application of KCl, which can depolarize both smooth muscle and endothelial cells (250 mM, 2.5-s pulse), also caused a rapid, spreading response consisting of depolarization followed by vasoconstriction. With KCl stimulation, in addition to changes in membrane potential, increases in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i were observed at distant sites not directly exposed to KCl. The rapid longitudinal spread of both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses support electrical coupling as the mode of signal transmission along the arteriolar length. In addition, the relatively short distance between heterologous cell types enables the superimposed radial Ca2+ signaling between smooth muscle and endothelial cells to modulate vasomotor responses.},

	Abstract = {Gap junctions play essential roles in the normal function of the heart and arteries, mediating the spread of the electrical impulse that stimulates synchronized contraction of the cardiac chambers, and contributing to co-ordination of activities between cells of the arterial wall. In common with other multicellular systems, cardiovascular tissues express multiple connexin isotypes that confer distinctive channel properties. This review highlights how state-of-the-art immunocytochemical and cellular imaging techniques, as part of a multidisciplinary approach in gap junction research, have advanced our understanding of connexin diversity in cardiovascular cell function in health and disease. In the heart, spatially defined patterns of expression of three connexin isotypes-connexin43, connexin40, and connexin45-underlie the precisely orchestrated patterns of current flow governing the normal cardiac rhythm. Derangement of gap junction organization and/or reduced expression of connexin43 are associated with arrhythmic tendency in the diseased human ventricle, and high levels of connexin40 in the atrium are associated with increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation after coronary by-pass surgery. In the major arteries, endothelial gap junctions may simultaneously express three connexin isotypes, connexin40, connexin37, and connexin43; underlying medial smooth muscle, by contrast, predominantly expresses connexin43, with connexin45 additionally expressed at restricted sites. In normal arterial smooth muscle, the abundance of connexin43 gap junctions varies according to vascular site, and shows an inverse relationship with desmin expression and positive correlation with the quantity of extracellular matrix. Increased connexin43 expression between smooth muscle cells is closely linked to phenotypic transformation in early human coronary atherosclerosis and in the response of the arterial wall to injury. Current evidence thus suggests that gap junctions in both their guises, as pathways for cell-to-cell signaling in the vessel wall and as pathways for impulse conduction in the heart, contribute to the initial pathogenesis and eventual clinical manifestation of human cardiovascular disease.},

	Abstract = {The etiology behind and physiological significance of spontaneous oscillations in the low-frequency spectrum in both systemic and cerebral vessels remain unknown. Experimental studies have proposed that spontaneous oscillations in cerebral blood flow reflect impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA). Analysis of CA by measurement of spontaneous oscillations in the low-frequency spectrum in cerebral vessels might be a useful tool for assessing risk and investigating different treatment strategies in carotid artery disease (CAD) and stroke. We reviewed studies exploring spontaneous oscillations in the low-frequency spectrum in patients with CAD and ischemic stroke, conditions known to involve impaired CA. Several studies have reported changes in oscillations after CAD and stroke after surgery and over time compared with healthy controls. Phase shift in the frequency domain and correlation coefficients in the time domain are the most frequently used parameters for analyzing spontaneous oscillations in systemic and cerebral vessels. At present, there is no gold standard for analyzing spontaneous oscillations in the low-frequency spectrum, and simplistic models of CA have failed to predict or explain the spontaneous oscillation changes found in CAD and stroke studies. Near-infrared spectroscopy is suggested as a future complementary tool for assessing changes affecting the cortical arterial system. {\textcopyright}2010 by National Stroke Association.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) derived from nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is an important paracrine effector that maintains vascular tone. The release of NO mediated by NOS isozymes under various O2 conditions critically determines the NO bioavailability in tissues. Because of experimental difficulties, there has been no direct information on how enzymatic NO production and distribution change around arterioles under various oxygen conditions. In this study, we used computational models based on the analysis of biochemical pathways of enzymatic NO synthesis and the availability of NOS isozymes to quantify the NO production by neuronal NOS (NOS1) and endothelial NOS (NOS3). We compared the catalytic activities of NOS1 and NOS3 and their sensitivities to the concentration of substrate O2. Based on the NO release rates predicted from kinetic models, the geometric distribution of NO sources, and mass balance analysis, we predicted the NO concentration profiles around an arteriole under various O2 conditions. The results indicated that NOS1-catalyzed NO production was significantly more sensitive to ambient O2 concentration than that catalyzed by NOS3. Also, the high sensitivity of NOS1 catalytic activity to O2 was associated with significantly reduced NO production and therefore NO concentrations, upon hypoxia. Moreover, the major source determining the distribution of NO was NOS1, which was abundantly expressed in the nerve fibers and mast cells close to arterioles, rather than NOS3, which was expressed in the endothelium. Finally, the perivascular NO concentration predicted by the models under conditions of normoxia was paradoxically at least an order of magnitude lower than a number of experimental measurements, suggesting a higher abundance of NOS1 or NOS3 and/or the existence of other enzymatic or nonenzymatic sources of NO in the microvasculature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Endothelial cells (ECs) govern smooth muscle cell (SMC) tone via the release of paracrine factors (eg, NO and metabolites of arachidonic acid). We tested the hypothesis that ECs can promote SMC relaxation or contraction via direct electrical coupling. Vessels (resting diameter, 57+/-3 microm; length, 4 mm) were isolated, cannulated, and pressurized (75 mm Hg; 37 degrees C). Two microelectrodes were used to simultaneously impale 2 cells (ECs or SMCs) in the vessel wall separated by 500 microm. Impalements of one EC and one SMC (n=26) displayed equivalent membrane potentials at rest, during spontaneous oscillations, and during hyperpolarization and vasodilation to acetylcholine. Injection of -0.8 nA into an EC caused hyperpolarization ( approximately 5 mV) and relaxation of SMCs (dilation, approximately 5 microm) along the vessel segment. In a reciprocal manner, +0.8 nA caused depolarization ( approximately 2 mV) of SMCs with constriction ( approximately 2 microm). Current injection into SMCs while recording from ECs produced similar results. We conclude that ECs and SMCs are electrically coupled to each other in these vessels, such that electrical signals conducted along the endothelium can be directly transmitted to the surrounding smooth muscle to evoke vasomotor responses.},

In this first paper, we construct a mathematical model consisting of a single conductance-based neuron together with intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics. We formulate a reduction of this model that permits a detailed bifurcation analysis, and show that the reduced model is a reasonable approximation of the full model. We find that competition between intrinsic neuronal currents, sodium-potassium pumps, glia, and diffusion can produce very slow and large-amplitude oscillations in ion concentrations similar to what is seen physiologically in seizures. Using the reduced model, we identify the dynamical mechanisms that give rise to these phenomena. These models reveal several experimentally testable predictions. Our work emphasizes the critical role of ion concentration homeostasis in the proper functioning of neurons, and points to important fundamental processes that may underlie pathological states such as epilepsy.},

	Abstract = {beta-Amyloid protein (A beta) is the major component of the senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglial cells have been shown to be closely associated with these plaques. However, the roles of A beta and microglial cells in pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. Incubation of rat microglial cells with A beta(1-40) caused a significant increase in nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide (NO), in culture media, while there was no detectable increase in nitrite in astrocyte-rich glial cells or cortical neurons after incubation with A beta(1-40). Nitrite production by microglial cells was also induced by A beta(1-42), but not A beta(25-35). An inhibitor of NO synthase, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), as well as dexamethasone and actinomycin D, dose-dependently inhibited this nitrite production. Among the various cytokines investigated such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), only IFN-gamma markedly enhanced A beta-dependent nitrite production. Cultured cortical neurons were injured by microglial cells stimulated with A beta in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of IFN-gamma. Neurotoxicity caused by the A beta plus IFN-gamma-stimulated microglial cells was significantly attenuated by NMMA. Thus, although further investigations into the effect of A beta on human microglial cells are needed, it is likely that A beta-induced NO production by microglial cells is one mechanism of the neuronal death in AD.},

One important class of oscillations and waves is dependent on the presence of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from internal stores via the IP3 receptor/Ca2+ channel. With the minimum possible mathematical formalism, we review mechanistic models for IP3-dependent Ca2+ oscillations and waves. These models are based on the regulation of the IP3 receptor by both IP3 and Ca2+, and incorporate experimental data on the steady-state and kinetic properties of the receptor. The extension of the models to describe intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ waves is considered.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the regional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal response to rapid changes in arterial oxygen tension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Functional MR imaging (fMRI) was carried out in five male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with Sodium Pentobarbital. Rats were subjected to different durations of apnea as a rapid, graded, and reversible hypoxic-hypercapnic stimulus. Dynamics of the BOLD signal response were studied on a pixel-by-pixel basis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, third ventricle, and thalamus in the rat brain. RESULTS: Apnea induced a BOLD signal drop in all the brain regions studied, the magnitude of which increased with longer durations of the stimulus. The signal recovered to preapnic baseline levels after resumption of normal ventilation. Regional variation in the BOLD signal dynamics was observed with the magnitude of the BOLD signal change in the hippocampus being the least, followed by a relatively larger change in the thalamus, cerebral cortex, and third ventricle. The time (t(0)) for the signal change after the onset of the stimulus was estimated for every pixel. Time delay maps generated show the highest onset time values in the hippocampus followed by the thalamus, cerebral cortex, and third ventricle. CONCLUSION: The regional dynamics of the BOLD signal in the brain in response to apnea may vary depending on the rate of oxygen metabolism in addition to cerebral blood flow (CBF).},

	Abstract = {Intracerebral (parenchymal) arterioles are morphologically and physiologically unique compared with pial arteries and arterioles. The ability of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to induce vasospasm in large-diameter pial arteries has been extensively studied, although the contribution of this phenomenon to patient outcome is controversial. Currently, little is known regarding the impact of SAH on parenchymal arterioles, which are critical for regulation of local and global cerebral blood flow. Here diameter, smooth muscle intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), and membrane potential measurements were used to assess the function of intact brain parenchymal arterioles isolated from unoperated (control), sham-operated, and SAH model rats. At low intravascular pressure (5 mmHg), membrane potential and [Ca(2+)](i) were not different in arterioles from control, sham-operated, and SAH animals. However, raising intravascular pressure caused significantly greater membrane potential depolarization, elevation in [Ca(2+)](i), and constriction in SAH arterioles. This SAH-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and tone occurred in the absence of the vascular endothelium and was abolished by the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) inhibitor nimodipine. Arteriolar [Ca(2+)](i) and tone were not different between groups when smooth muscle membrane potential was adjusted to the same value. Protein and mRNA levels of the L-type VDCC Ca(V)1.2 were similar in parenchymal arterioles isolated from control and SAH animals, suggesting that SAH did not cause VDCC upregulation. We conclude that enhanced parenchymal arteriolar tone after SAH is driven by smooth muscle membrane potential depolarization, leading to increased L-type VDCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are well established as messenger molecules throughout the body, gasotransmitters, based on striking alterations in mice lacking the appropriate biosynthetic enzymes. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is even more chemically reactive, but until recently there was little definitive evidence for its physiologic formation. Cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22), and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE; EC 4.4.1.1), also known as cystathionine, can generate H(2)S from cyst(e)ine. Very recent studies with mice lacking these enzymes have established that CSE is responsible for H(2)S formation in the periphery, while in the brain cystathionine beta-synthase is the biosynthetic enzyme. Endothelial-derived relaxing factor activity is reduced 80{\%} in the mesenteric artery of mice with deletion of CSE, establishing H(2)S as a major physiologic endothelial-derived relaxing factor. H(2)S appears to signal predominantly by S-sulfhydrating cysteines in its target proteins, analogous to S-nitrosylation by NO. Whereas S-nitrosylation typically inhibits enzymes, S-sulfhydration activates them. S-nitrosylation basally affects 1-2{\%} of its target proteins, while 10-25{\%} of H(2)S target proteins are S-sulfhydrated. In summary, H(2)S appears to be a physiologic gasotransmitter of comparable importance to NO and carbon monoxide.},

The patients were evaluated by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR0-CDR3) and studied in the Memory and Aging Project (MAP) of the Washington University Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADCR). With the use of immunocytochemical procedures, neurons immunoreactive to nNOS were found to show large and small multipolar and pyramidal morphologies over the entire chronic AD evolution. The iNOS and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivities were also found in pyramidal-like cortical neurons and glial cells.

	Abstract = {Astrocytic gap junctions have been suggested to contribute to spatial buffering of potassium in the brain. Direct evidence has been difficult to gather because of the lack of astrocyte-specific gap junction blockers. We obtained mice with coupling-deficient astrocytes by crossing conditional connexin43-deficient mice with connexin30(-/-) mice. Similar to wild-type astrocytes, genetically uncoupled hippocampal astrocytes displayed negative resting membrane potentials, time- and voltage-independent whole-cell currents, and typical astrocyte morphologies. Astrocyte densities were also unchanged. Using potassium-selective microelectrodes, we assessed changes in potassium buffering in hippocampal slices of mice with coupling-deficient astrocytes. We demonstrate that astrocytic gap junctions accelerate potassium clearance, limit potassium accumulation during synchronized neuronal firing, and aid in radial potassium relocation in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. Furthermore, slices of mice with coupling-deficient astrocytes displayed a reduced threshold for the generation of epileptiform events. However, it was evident that radial relocation of potassium in the stratum radiatum was not dependent on gap junctional coupling. We suggest that the perpendicular array of individual astrocytes in the stratum radiatum makes these cells ideally suited for spatial buffering of potassium released by pyramidal cells, independent of gap junctions. In general, a surprisingly large capacity for K+ clearance was conserved in mice with coupling-deficient astrocytes, indicating that gap junction-dependent processes only partially account for K+ buffering in the hippocampus.},

@article{Kim2006,
	Abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach was presented to model the blood flows in the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries under altered gravity. Physical models required for CFD simulation were introduced including a model for arterial wall motion due to fluid-wall interactions, a shear thinning fluid model of blood, a vascular bed model for outflow boundary conditions, and a model for autoregulation mechanism. The three-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with these models were solved iteratively using the pseudocompressibility method and dual time stepping. Gravity source terms were added to the Navier-Stokes equations to take the effect of gravity into account. For the treatment of complex geometry, a chimera overset grid technique was adopted to obtain connectivity between arterial branches. For code validation, computed results were compared with experimental data for both steady-state and time-dependent flows. This computational approach was then applied to blood flows through a realistic carotid bifurcation and two Circle of Willis models, one using an idealized geometry and the other using an anatomical data set. A three-dimensional Circle of Willis configuration was reconstructed from subject-specific magnetic resonance images using an image segmentation method. Through the numerical simulation of blood flow in two model problems, namely, the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries, it was observed that the altered gravity has considerable effects on arterial contraction/dilatation and consequent changes in flow conditions.},

@article{Newington2013,
	Abstract = {The conventional view of central nervous system (CNS) metabolism is based on the assumption that glucose is the main fuel source for active neurons and is processed in an oxidative manner. However, since the early 1990s research has challenged the idea that the energy needs of nerve cells are met exclusively by glucose and oxidative metabolism. This alternative view of glucose utilization contends that astrocytes metabolize glucose to lactate, which is then released and taken up by nearby neurons and used as a fuel source, commonly known as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) model. Once thought of as a waste metabolite, lactate has emerged as a central player in the maintenance of neuronal function and long-term memory. Decreased neuronal metabolism has traditionally been viewed as a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a more complex picture of CNS metabolism is emerging that may provide valuable insight into the pathophysiological changes that occur during AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. This review will examine the ANLS model and present recent evidence highlighting the critical role that lactate plays in neuronal survival and memory. Moreover, the role of glucose and lactate metabolism in AD will be re-evaluated from the perspective of the ANLS.},

The model comprises detailed descriptions of endothelial (ECs) and smooth muscle (SM) cells (SMCs), coupled by nonselective gap junctions. With strong myoendothelial coupling, local agonist stimulation of the EC or SM layer causes local changes in membrane potential (V(m)) that are conducted electrotonically, primarily through the endothelium. When myoendothelial coupling is weak, signals initiated in the SM conduct poorly, but the sensitivity of the SMCs to current injection andKapela, A., Nagaraja, S., {\&} Tsoukias, N. M. (2010).

Thus physiological transmembrane currents can induce different levels of local V(m) change, depending on cell's gap junction connectivity. The physiological relevance of current and voltage clamp stimulations in intact vessels is discussed. Focal agonist stimulation of the endothelium reduces cytosolic calcium (intracellular Ca(2+) concentration) in the prestimulated SM layer. This SMC Ca(2+) reduction is attributed to a spread of EC hyperpolarization via gap junctions. Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, but not Ca(2+), diffusion through homocellular gap junctions can increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in neighboring ECs. The small endothelial Ca(2+) spread can amplify the total current generated at the local site by the ECs and through the nitric oxide pathway, by the SMCs, and thus reduces the number of stimulated cells required to induce distant responses. The distance of the electrotonic and Ca(2+) spread depends on the magnitude of SM prestimulation and the number of SM layers. Model results are consistent with experimental data for vasoreactivity in rat mesenteric resistance arteries.},

	Abstract = {Ischemic depolarizing events, such as repetitive spontaneous periinfarct spreading depolarizations (PIDs), expand the infarct size after experimental middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. This worsening may result from increased metabolic demand, exacerbating the mismatch between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism. Here, we present data showing that anoxic depolarization (AD) and PIDs caused vasoconstriction and abruptly reduced CBF in the ischemic cortex in a distal MCA occlusion model in mice. This reduction in CBF during AD increased the area of cortex with 20{\%} or less residual CBF by 140{\%}. With each subsequent PID, this area expanded by an additional 19{\%}. Drugs that are known to inhibit cortical spreading depression (CSD), such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists MK-801 and 7-chlorokynurenic acid, and sigma-1 receptor agonists dextromethorphan and carbetapentane, did not reduce the frequency of PIDs, but did diminish the severity of episodic hypoperfusions, and prevented the expansion of severely hypoperfused cortex, thus improving CBF during 90 mins of acute focal ischemia. In contrast, AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX, which does not inhibit CSD, did not impact the deterioration in CBF. When measured 24 h after distal MCA occlusion, infarct size was reduced by MK-801, but not by NBQX. Our results suggest that AD and PIDs expand the CBF deficit, and by so doing negatively impact lesion development in ischemic mouse brain. Mitigating the vasoconstrictive neurovascular coupling during intense ischemic depolarizations may provide a novel hemodynamic mechanism of neuroprotection by inhibitors of CSD.},

	Abstract = {This brief review serves as a refresher on smooth muscle physiology for those educators who teach in medical and graduate courses of physiology. Additionally, those professionals who are in need of an update on smooth muscle physiology may find this review to be useful. Smooth muscle lacks the striations characteristic of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Layers of smooth muscle cells line the walls of various organs and tubes in the body, and the contractile function of smooth muscle is not under voluntary control. Contractile activity in smooth muscle is initiated by a Ca(2+)-calmodulin interaction to stimulate phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin. Ca(2+) sensitization of the contractile proteins is signaled by the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway to inhibit the dephosphorylation of the light chain by myosin phosphatase, thereby maintaining force generation. Removal of Ca(2+) from the cytosol and stimulation of myosin phosphatase initiate the process of smooth muscle relaxation.},

The present article appeals to these hallmarks to evaluate and contrast two competing models of AD: the amyloid hypothesis (a neuron-centric mechanism) and the Inverse Warburg hypothesis (a neuron-astrocytic mechanism). We show that these three hallmarks of AD conflict with the amyloid hypothesis, but are consistent with the Inverse Warburg hypothesis, a bioenergetic model which postulates that AD is the result of a cascade of three events-mitochondrial dysregulation, metabolic reprogramming (the Inverse Warburg effect), and natural selection. We also provide an explanation for the failures of the clinical trials based on amyloid immunization, and we propose a new class of therapeutic strategies consistent with the neuroenergetic selection model.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms that link a transient neural activity to the corresponding increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) are termed neurovascular coupling (NVC). They are possibly impaired at early stages of small vessel or neurodegenerative diseases. Investigation of NVC in humans has been made possible with the development of various neuroimaging techniques based on variations of local hemodynamics during neural activity. Specific dynamic models are currently used for interpreting these data that can include biophysical parameters related to NVC. After a brief review of the current knowledge about possible mechanisms acting in NVC we selected seven models with explicit integration of NVC found in the literature. All these models were described using the same procedure. We compared their physiological assumptions, mathematical formalism, and validation. In particular, we pointed out their strong differences in terms of complexity. Finally, we discussed their validity and their potential applications. These models may provide key information to investigate various aspects of NVC in human pathology.},

	Abstract = {Primary cilia are solitary, generally non-motile, hair-like protrusions that extend from the surface of cells between cell divisions. Their antenna-like structure leads naturally to the assumption that they sense the surrounding environment, the most common hypothesis being sensation of mechanical force through calcium-permeable ion channels within the cilium1. This Ca2+-responsive mechanosensor hypothesis for primary cilia has been invoked to explain a large range of biological responses, from control of left--right axis determination in embryonic development to adult progression of polycystic kidney disease and some cancers2,3. Here we report the complete lack of mechanically induced calcium increases in primary cilia, in tissues upon which this hypothesis has been based. We developed a transgenic mouse, Arl13b--mCherry--GECO1.2, expressing a ratiometric genetically encoded calcium indicator in all primary cilia. We then measured responses to flow in primary cilia of cultured kidney epithelial cells, kidney thick ascending tubules, crown cells of the embryonic node, kinocilia of inner ear hair cells, and several cell lines. Cilia-specific Ca2+ influxes were not observed in physiological or even highly supraphysiological levels of fluid flow. We conclude that mechanosensation, if it originates in primary cilia, is not via calcium signalling.},

	Abstract = {The focal location of atherosclerosis in the vascular tree is correlated with local variations in shear stress. We developed a method to induce defined variations in shear stress in a straight vessel segment of a mouse. To this end, a cylinder with a tapered lumen was placed around the carotid artery, inducing a high shear stress field. Concomitantly, regions of low shear stress and oscillatory shear stress were created upstream and down-stream of the device, respectively. This device was used in mice transgenic for an eNOS3GFP fusion gene. We observed a strong induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase-green fluorescent protein (eNOS-GFP) mRNA expression in the high shear stress region compared with the other regions (P {\textless} .05). Quantification of eNOS-GFP fluorescence or of immunoreactivity to the Golgi complex or to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) showed an increase in the high shear stress region (P {\textless} .05) compared with nontreated carotid arteries. Colocalization of eNOS-GFP with either the Golgi complex or PECAM-1 also responded to alterations of shear stress. In conclusion, we showed a direct response of mRNA and protein expression in vivo to induced variations of shear stress. This model provides the opportunity to study the relationship between shear stress alterations, gene expression, and atherosclerosis.},

	Abstract = {Modern functional imaging techniques of the brain measure local hemodynamic responses evoked by neuronal activity. Capillary pericytes recently were suggested to mediate neurovascular coupling in brain slices, but their role in vivo remains unexplored. We used two-photon microscopy to study in real time pericytes and the dynamic changes of capillary diameter and blood flow in the cortex of anesthetized mice, as well as in brain slices. The thromboxane A(2) analog, 9,11-dideoxy-9$\alpha$,11$\alpha$-methanoepoxy Prostaglandin F2$\alpha$ (U46619), induced constrictions in the vicinity of pericytes in a fraction of capillaries, whereas others dilated. The changes in vessel diameter resulted in changes in capillary red blood cell (RBC) flow. In contrast, during brief epochs of seizure activity elicited by local administration of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, capillary RBC flow increased without pericyte-induced capillary diameter changes. Precapillary arterioles were the smallest vessels to dilate, together with penetrating and pial arterioles. Our results provide in vivo evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary blood flow in the brain, which may be important under pathological conditions. However, our data suggest that precapillary and penetrating arterioles, rather than pericytes in capillaries, are responsible for the blood flow increase induced by neural activity.},

@article{Ventura1999,
	Abstract = {Recent studies show that glutamate transporter-mediated currents occur in astrocytes when glutamate is released from hippocampal synapses. These transporters remove excess glutamate from the extracellular space, thereby facilitating synaptic input specificity and preventing neurotoxicity. Little is known about the position of astrocytic processes at hippocampal synapses. Serial electron microscopy and three-dimensional analyses were used to investigate structural relationships between astrocytes and synapses in stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA1 in the mature rat in vivo and in slices. Only 57 +/- 11{\%} of the synapses had astrocytic processes apposed to them. Of these, the astrocytic processes surrounded less than half (0.43 +/- 22) of the synaptic interface. Other studies suggest that astrocytes extend processes toward higher concentrations of glutamate; thus the presence of astrocytic processes at particular hippocampal synapses might signal which ones are releasing glutamate. The distance between nearest neighboring synapses was usually (approximately 95{\%}) {\textless}1 microgram. Astrocytic processes occurred along the extracellular path between 33{\%} of the neighboring synapses, neuronal processes occurred along the path between another 66{\%} of the neighboring synapses, and only 1{\%} of the synapses were close enough such that neither astrocytic nor neuronal processes occurred between them. These morphological arrangements suggest that the glutamate released at approximately two-thirds of hippocampal synapses might diffuse to other synapses, unless neuronal glutamate transporters are more effective than previously reported. The findings also suggest that physiological recordings made from hippocampal astrocytes do not uniformly sample the glutamate released from all hippocampal synapses.},

	Abstract = {Hemodynamic shear stress, the frictional force acting on vascular endothelial cells, is crucial for endothelial homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. When discussing blood flow effects on various forms of endothelial (dys)function, one considers two flow patterns: steady laminar flow and disturbed flow because endothelial cells respond differently to these flow types both in vivo and in vitro. Laminar flow which exerts steady laminar shear stress is atheroprotective while disturbed flow creates an atheroprone environment. Emerging evidence has provided new insights into the cellular mechanisms of flow-dependent regulation of vascular function that leads to cardiovascular events such as atherosclerosis, atherothrombosis, and myocardial infarction. In order to study effects of shear stress and different types of flow, various models have been used. In this review, we will summarize our current views on how disturbed flow-mediated signaling pathways are involved in the development of atherosclerosis.},

	Abstract = {Activation of the basal forebrain (BF), the primary source of acetylcholine (ACh) in the cortex, broadly increases cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF), a response downstream to ACh release. Although endothelial nitric oxide and cholinoceptive GABA ({\$}\gamma{\$}-aminobutyric acid) interneurons have been implicated, little is known about the role of pyramidal cells in this response and their possible interaction with astrocytes. Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry as a marker of neuronal activation and laser-Doppler flowmetry, we measured changes in CBF evoked by BF stimulation following pharmacological blockade of c-Fos-identified excitatory pathways, astroglial metabolism, or vasoactive mediators. Pyramidal cells including those that express cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) displayed c-Fos upregulation. Glutamate acting via NMDA, AMPA, and mGlu receptors was involved in the evoked CBF response, NMDA receptors having the highest contribution ({\~{}}33{\%}). In contrast, nonselective and selective COX-2 inhibition did not affect the evoked CBF response (+0.4{\%} to 6.9{\%}, ns). The metabolic gliotoxins fluorocitrate and fluoroacetate, the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase inhibitor MS-PPOH and the selective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid (14,15-EEZE) all blocked the evoked CBF response by {\~{}}50{\%}. Together, the data demonstrate that the hyperemic response to BF stimulation is largely mediated by glutamate released from activated pyramidal cells and by vasoactive EETs, likely originating from activated astrocytes.},

We used two-photon imaging of calcium signals in the ferret visual cortex in vivo to discover that astrocytes, like neurons, respond to visual stimuli, with distinct spatial receptive fields and sharp tuning to visual stimulus features including orientation and spatial frequency. The stimulus-feature preferences of astrocytes were exquisitely mapped across the cortical surface, in close register with neuronal maps. The spatially restricted stimulus-specific component of the intrinsic hemodynamic mapping signal was highly sensitive to astrocyte activation, indicating that astrocytes have a key role in coupling neuronal organization to mapping signals critical for noninvasive brain imaging. Furthermore, blocking astrocyte glutamate transporters influenced the magnitude and duration of adjacent visually driven neuronal responses.},

	Abstract = {Endothelial cells release several compounds, including prostacyclin, NO, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), that mediate the vascular effects of vasoactive hormones. The identity of EDHF remains unknown. Since arachidonic acid causes endothelium-dependent relaxations of coronary arteries through its metabolism to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by cytochrome P450, we wondered if the EETs represent EDHFs. Precontracted bovine coronary arteries relaxed in an endothelium-dependent manner to methacholine. The cytochrome P450 inhibitors, SKF 525A and miconazole, significantly attenuated these relaxations. They were also inhibited by tetraethylammonium (TEA),an inhibitor of Ca2+-activated K+ channels, and by high [K+]0 (20 mmol/L). Methacholine also caused hyperpolarization of coronary smooth muscle (-27 +/- 3.9 versus -40 +/- 5.1 mV), which was completely blocked by SKF 525A and miconazole. In vessels prelabeled with [3H] arachidonic acid, methacholine stimulated the release of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1alpha, 12-HETE, and the EETs. Arachidonic acid relaxed precontracted coronary arteries, which were also blocked by TEA, charybdotoxin, another Ca2+-activated K+ channel inhibitor, and high [K+]0. 14,15-EET, 11,12-EET, 8,9-EET, and 5,6-EET relaxed precontracted coronary vessels (EC50, 1 X 10(-6) mol/L). The four regioisomers were equally active. TEA, charybdotoxin, and high [K+]0 attenuated the EET relaxations. 11,12-EET hyperpolarized coronary smooth muscle cells from -37 +/- 0.2 to -59 +/- 0.3 mV. In the cell-attached mode of patch clamp, both 14,15-EET and 11,12-EET increased the open-state probability of a Ca2+-activated K+ channel in coronary smooth muscle cells. This effect was blocked by TEA and charybdotoxin. These data support the hypothesis that the EETs are EDHFs.},

Abnor- mal EC responses to shear stress impair various vascular functions and lead to vascular diseases, including hyper- tension, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. Bioengineering approaches in which cultured ECs are subjected to shear stress in fluid-dynamically designed flow-loading devices have been widely used to analyze EC responses at the cellular and molecular levels. Remarkable progress has been made, and the results have shown that ECs alter their morphology, function, and gene expression in response to shear stress. Shear stress affects immature cells, as well as mature ECs, and promotes differentiation of bone-marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells and embryonic stem cells into ECs. Much research has been done on shear stress sensing and signal transduction, and their molecular mechanisms are gradually coming to be understood. However, much remains uncertain, and many candidates have been proposed for shear stress sensors. More extensive studies of vascular mechanobiology should increase our understanding of the molecular basis of the blood-flow-mediated control of vascular func- tions.},

@article{Emerson2002,
	Abstract = {The conduction of vasodilation along resistance vessels has been presumed to reflect the electrotonic spread of hyperpolarization from cell to cell along the vessel wall through gap junction channels. However, the vasomotor response to acetylcholine (ACh) encompasses greater distances than can be explained by passive decay. To investigate the underlying mechanism for this behavior, we tested the hypothesis that ACh augments the conduction of hyperpolarization. Feed arteries (n = 23; diameter, 58 +/- 4 microm; segment length, 2-8 mm) were isolated from the hamster retractor muscle, cannulated at each end, and pressurized to 75 mmHg (at 37 degrees C). Vessels were impaled with one or two dye-containing microelectrodes simultaneously (separation distance, 50 microm to 3.5 mm). Membrane potential (E(m)) (rest, approximately -30 mV) and electrical responses were similar between endothelium and smooth muscle, as predicted for robust myoendothelial coupling. Current injection (-0.8 nA, 1.5 s) evoked hyperpolarization (-10 +/- 1 mV; membrane time constant, 240 ms) that conducted along the vessel with a length constant (lambda) = 1.2 +/- 0.1 mm; spontaneous E(m) oscillations (approximately 1 Hz) decayed with lambda = 1.2 + 0.1 mm. In contrast, ACh microiontophoresis (500 nA, 500 ms, 1 microm tip) evoked hyperpolarization (-14 +/- 2 mV) that conducted with lambda = 1.9 +/- 0.1 mm, 60{\%} further (P {\textless}0.05) than responses evoked by purely electrical stimuli. These findings indicate that ACh augments the conduction of hyperpolarization along the vessel wall.},

	Abstract = {Prior 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments, which simultaneously measured in vivo rates of total glutamate-glutamine cycling (V(cyc(tot))) and neuronal glucose oxidation (CMR(glc(ox), N)), revealed a linear relationship between these fluxes above isoelectricity, with a slope of approximately 1. In vitro glial culture studies examining glutamate uptake indicated that glutamate, which is cotransported with Na+, stimulated glial uptake of glucose and release of lactate. These in vivo and in vitro results were consolidated into a model: recycling of one molecule of neurotransmitter between glia and neurons was associated with oxidation of one glucose molecule in neurons; however, the glucose was taken up only by glia and all the lactate (pyruvate) generated by glial glycolysis was transferred to neurons for oxidation. The model was consistent with the 1:1 relationship between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) measured by 13C MRS. However, the model could not specify the energetics of glia and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons because quantitative values for these pathways were not available. Here, we review recent 13C and 14C tracer studies that enable us to include these fluxes in a more comprehensive model. The revised model shows that glia produce at least 8{\%} of total oxidative ATP and GABAergic neurons generate approximately 18{\%} of total oxidative ATP in neurons. Neurons produce at least 88{\%} of total oxidative ATP, and take up approximately 26{\%} of the total glucose oxidized. Glial lactate (pyruvate) still makes the major contribution to neuronal oxidation, but approximately 30{\%} less than predicted by the prior model. The relationship observed between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) is determined by glial glycolytic ATP as before. Quantitative aspects of the model, which can be tested by experimentation, are discussed.},

The related coefficient constraints are collected in two corollaries. We present the constraints to the general solution of the Korn--Lichtenstein equations which directly generates Gau{\ss}--Kr{\"{u}}ger conformal coordinates as well as the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) avoiding any intermediate isometric coordinate representation. Namely, the equidistant mapping of a meridian of reference generates the constraints in question.

	Abstract = {The analysis of hemodynamic parameters and functional reactivity of cerebral capillaries is still controversial. To assess the hemodynamic parameters in the cortical capillary network, a generic model was created using 2D voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. This method is capable of creating an appropriate generic model of cerebral capillary network relating to each part of the brain cortex because the geometric model is able to vary the capillary density. The modeling presented here is based on morphometric parameters extracted from physiological data of the human cortex. The pertinent hemodynamic parameters were obtained by numerical simulation based on effective blood viscosity as a function of hematocrit and microvessel diameter, phase separation and plasma skimming effects. The hemodynamic parameters of capillary networks with two different densities (consistent with the variation of the morphometric data in the human cortical capillary network) were analyzed. The results show pertinent hemodynamic parameters for each model. The heterogeneity (coefficient variation) and the mean value of hematocrits, flow rates and velocities of the both network models were specified. The distributions of blood flow throughout the both models seem to confirm the hypothesis in which all capillaries in a cortical network are recruited at rest (normal condition). The results also demonstrate a discrepancy of the network resistance between two models, which are derived from the difference in the number density of capillary segments between the models.},

	Abstract = {We show that the EPI time course in functional MR imaging at 4 Tesla displays a multiphasic response in response to photic stimulation. Focal areas of gray matter display an initial negative change in signal intensity that reaches a maximum of 1{\%} about 2 s after the onset of photic stimulation. This component then changes sign, reaching a positive maximum about 5 s after the onset of the stimulus. Other areas, including those where draining veins are visible, show only a positive signal change, reaching a maximum of about 6{\%} after the onset of the visual stimulus. These time constants are in very good agreement with published data obtained with intrinsic optical mapping techniques, where a deoxygenation phase has been shown to occur in functionally specific cortical columns, followed by an increase in blood volume which is more distributed in nature. Thus, we believe there is strong evidence that a sensitivity to capillary oxygenation state is present in high S/N functional MR images obtained with EPI at 4 T.},

	Abstract = {While it is well established that stroke and cerebral hypoperfusion are both significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, the molecular link between ischemia and amyloid precursor protein processing has only been recently established. Specifically, hypoxia significantly increases beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) gene transcription through the over-expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha, resulting in increased BACE1 secretase activity and amyloid-beta production. In this study, we significantly extend these findings both in vitro, in differentiated SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells, and in vivo, in rats subjected to cerebral ischemia, showing that hypoxia up-regulates BACE1 expression through a biphasic mechanism. The early post-hypoxic up-regulation of BACE1 depends on the production of reactive oxygen species mediated by the sudden interruption of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, while the later expression of BACE1 is caused by hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha activation. The involvement of reactive oxygen species released by mitochondria in the BACE1 up-regulation was confirmed by the complete protection exerted by complex I inhibitors such as rotenone and diphenyl-phenylen iodonium. Moreover, the oxidative stress-mediated up-regulation of BACE1 is mediated by c-jun N terminal kinase pathway as demonstrated by the protection exerted by the silencing of c-jun N-terminal kinase isoforms 1 and 2. Our study strengthens the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a basic common mechanism of amyloid-beta accumulation.},

@article{Mattson2003,
	Abstract = {Cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) result from the degeneration of synapses and death of neurons in the limbic system and associated regions of the cerebral cortex. An alteration in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in increased production and accumulation of amyloid ??-peptide (A??) in the brain. A?? has been shown to cause synaptic dysfunction and can render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis by a mechanism involving disruption of cellular calcium homeostasis. By inducing membrane lipid peroxidation and generation of the aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal, A?? impairs the function of membrane ion-motive ATPases and glucose and glutamate transporters, and can enhance calcium influx through voltage-dependent and ligand-gated calcium channels. Reduced levels of a secreted form of APP which normally regulates synaptic plasticity and cell survival may also promote disruption of synaptic calcium homeostasis in AD. Some cases of inherited AD are caused by mutations in presenilins 1 and 2 which perturb endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium homeostasis such that greater amounts of calcium are released upon stimulation, possibly as the result of alterations in IP3 and ryanodine receptor channels, Ca2+-ATPases and the ER stress protein Herp. Abnormalities in calcium regulation in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia have also been documented in studies of experimental models of AD, suggesting contributions of these alterations to neuronal dysfunction and cell death in AD. Collectively, the available data show that perturbed cellular calcium homeostasis plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD, suggesting potential benefits of preventative and therapeutic strategies that stabilize cellular calcium homeostasis. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Micropipette application of certain vasoconstrictor or -dilator substances onto the surface of arterioles induces both a local vasomotor response and a response which is propagated up- and downstream along the vessel, a so-called conducted vasomotor response. In some vascular beds conducted vasoconstrictor and dilator responses are detectable more than a millimetre from the site of agonist delivery. While agonists such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and KCl almost invariably give rise to conducted vasomotor responses others, such as sodium nitroprusside or vasopressin, do not. Conducted vasomotor responses in arterioles appear to rely on passive electrotonic spread of the change in membrane potential induced by the agonist at the tip of the pipette. Presumably the current spreads up- and downstream along the arteriolar wall through endothelial or smooth muscle cell gap junctions. Whether the electrical signal is conducted primarily through the endothelial or the smooth muscle cell layer or both is currently not known, but it may depend on the agonist used. Experiments have suggested that conducted vasodilation in skeletal muscle feed arterioles plays an important role in the development of functional hyperaemia at the onset of exercise. In the kidney, conducted vasoconstriction is believed to be responsible for the upstream contraction of the afferent arteriole and interlobular artery known to occur in response to activation of the macula densa. Therefore conducted vasoconstriction could be important for the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism. Finally, experimental studies have shown that conduction of vasomotor responses in arterioles may be altered in pathological conditions associated with microvascular dysfunction such as arterial hypertension and sepsis.},

	Abstract = {To test the novel hypothesis that the K+ efflux mediated by NMDA receptors might be regulated differently than the influx of Ca2+ and Na+ through the same receptor channels, NMDA receptor whole-cell currents carried concurrently or individually by Ca2+, Na+ and K+ were analysed in cultured mouse cortical neurons. In contrast to the NMDA inward current carried by Ca2+ and Na+, the NMDA receptor outward K+ current or NMDA-K current, recorded either in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ and Na+, and at different or the same membrane potentials, showed much less sensitivity to alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and underwent little rundown. In line with a selective regulation of the NMDA receptor K+ permeability, the ratio of the NMDA inward/outward currents decreased, and the reversal potential of composite NMDA currents recorded in physiological solutions shifted by -8.5 mV after repeated activation of NMDA receptors. Moreover, a depolarizing pre-pulse of a few seconds or a burst of brief depolarizing pulses selectively augmented the subsequent NMDA-K current, but not the NMDA inward current. On the other hand, a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse showed the opposite effect of reducing the NMDA-K current. The voltage- and activity-dependent regulation of the NMDA-K current did not require the existence of extracellular Ca2+ or Ca2+ influx; it was, however, affected by the duration of the pre-pulse and was subject to a time-dependent decay. The burst of excitatory activity revealed a lasting upregulation of the NMDA-K current even 5 s after termination of the pre-pulses. Our data reveal a selective regulation of the NMDA receptor K+ permeability and represent a novel model of voltage- and excitatory activity-dependent plasticity at the receptor level.},

@article{Kreisman2000,
	Abstract = {Pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus are highly vulnerable to damage from hypoxia-ischemia, whereas neurons in the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus are more resistant. A similar pattern of vulnerability to loss of synaptic and membrane function occurs in the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation, suggesting that intrinsic factors are important in acute neuronal damage. Simultaneous recordings of DC potential and imaging of changes in light transmittance were made in slices from the middle one-third of the hippocampus to characterize the initiation and spread of depolarization and swelling during hypoxia-aglycemia. Hypoxic depolarization (HD) and associated optical changes were initiated simultaneously in the stratum oriens of the CA1 region and thereafter spread to the stratum radiatum of CA1 and later to the upper (inner) blade of the dentate gyrus. A decrease in light transmittance was associated consistently with depolarization in all regions (n = 22 slices). Investigation of the sequence of activation in intact slices showed that activation of the dentate gyrus arose independently of activation of the CA1 region. This was confirmed by recordings made from minislices in which CA1, CA3, and dentate regions were physically separated. HD and optical changes were never observed in the CA3 region, despite exposure to 40-60 min of combined hypoxia and aglycemia. In contrast, exposure to hypoxia after pretreatment of slices with altered tonicity or ion composition, which triggered episodes of spreading depolarization (SD), provoked depolarization and optical changes simultaneously in both CA1 and CA3 regions. Similarly, pretreatment with agents that cause severe metabolic impairment, such as dinitrophenol (DNP), also rendered the CA3 region vulnerable to subsequent hypoxia. This suggests that the CA3 region in hippocampal slices is normally resistant to HD and only becomes vulnerable after severe impairment of metabolic capacity. The similar order of vulnerability of in vitro and in vivo hippocampus to hypoxia-aglycemia supports the use of the hippocampal slice preparation to investigate early changes potentially contributing to hypoxic-ischemic injury.},

	Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to provide a mechanistic insight into how 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) relaxes organ-cultured human bronchi. Tension measurements, performed on either fresh or 3-d-cultured bronchi, revealed that the contractile responses to 1 microM methacholine and 10 microM arachidonic acid were largely relaxed by the eicosanoid regioisomer in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-10 microM). Pretreatments with 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid, a specific 14,15-EET antagonist, prevented the relaxing effect, whereas iberitoxin pretreatments (10 nM) partially abolished EET-induced relaxations. In contrast, pretreatments with 1 microM indomethacin amplified relaxations in explants and membrane hyperpolarizations triggered by 14,15-EET on airway smooth muscle cells. The relaxing responses induced by 14,15-EET were likely related to reduced Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments, because free Ca2+ concentration-response curves performed on beta-escin-permeabilized cultured explants were shifted toward higher [Ca2+] (lower pCa2+ values). 14,15-EET also abolished the tonic responses induced by phorbol-ester-dybutyrate (PDBu) (a protein kinase C [PKC]-sensitizing agent), on both fresh (intact) and beta-escin-permeabilized explants. Western blot analyses, using two specific primary antibodies against CPI-17 and its PKC-dependent phosphorylated isoform (p-CPI-17), confirmed that the eicosanoid interferes with this intracellular process. These data indicate that 14,15-EET hyperpolarizes airway smooth muscle cells and relaxes precontracted human bronchi while reducing Ca2+ sensitivity of fresh and cultured explants. The intracellular effects are related to a PKC-dependent process involving a lower phosphorylation level of CPI-17.},

@article{Furchgott1980,
	Abstract = {Despite its very potent vasodilating action in vivo, acetylcholine (ACh) does not always produce relaxation of isolated preparations of blood vessels in vitro. For example, in the helical strip of the rabbit descending thoracic aorta, the only reported response to ACh has been graded contractions, occurring at concentrations above 0.1 muM and mediated by muscarinic receptors. Recently, we observed that in a ring preparation from the rabbit thoracic aorta, ACh produced marked relaxation at concentrations lower than those required to produce contraction (confirming an earlier report by Jelliffe). In investigating this apparent discrepancy, we discovered that the loss of relaxation of ACh in the case of the strip was the result of unintentional rubbing of its intimal surface against foreign surfaces during its preparation. If care was taken to avoid rubbing of the intimal surface during preparation, the tissue, whether ring, transverse strip or helical strip, always exhibited relaxation to ACh, and the possibility was considered that rubbing of the intimal surface had removed endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that relaxation of isolated preparations of rabbit thoracic aorta and other blood vessels by ACh requires the presence of endothelial cells, and that ACh, acting on muscarinic receptors of these cells, stimulates release of a substance(s) that causes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. We propose that this may be one of the principal mechanisms for ACh-induced vasodilation in vivo. Preliminary reports on some aspects of the work have been reported elsewhere.},

This article summarises the arguments for a causal role for either amyloid deposition or cerebrovascular pathology as the primary trigger in the development of non-genetic AD. A bare-bones survey of the published research reveals no compelling evidence that amyloid deposition is neurotoxic in human beings or that it results in neurodegenerative changes involving synaptic, metabolic, or neuronal loss in human or transgenic-mouse brains. By contrast, the data supporting AD as a primary vascular disorder are more convincing. Findings suggesting a vascular cause of AD come from epidemiological, neuroimaging, pathological, pharmacotherapeutic, and clinical studies. The consensus of these studies indicates that chronic brain hypoperfusion is linked to AD risk factors, AD preclinical detection and pharmacotherapeutic action of AD symptoms.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to simulate the spread of membrane potential changes in microvascular trees and then make the simulation programs accessible to other researchers. We have applied our simulations to demonstrate the implications of electrical coupling between arteriolar smooth muscle and endothelium. METHODS: A two-layered, cable-like model of an arteriole was used, and the assumptions involved in the approach explicitly stated. Several common experimental situations that involve the passive spread of membrane potential changes in microvascular trees were simulated. The calculations were performed using NEURON, a well-established computer simulation program that we have modified for use with vascular trees. RESULTS: Simulated results show that membrane potential changes would probably not spread as far in the endothelium as they would in the smooth muscle of arterioles. Where feed arteries are connected to larger distributing arteries, passive spread alone may not explain the physiologically observed spread of diameter changes. CONCLUSIONS: Simulated results suggest that the morphology of an arteriole, in which the muscle layer is much thicker than the endothelium, favors electrical conduction along smooth muscle rather than the endothelium. However, it seems that passive electrical spread is insufficient to explain the apparent spread of membrane potential changes in experimental situations. Active responses involving voltage-dependent conductances may be involved, and these can also be included in our simulation.},

	Abstract = {Cerebral microvessels have a unique ultrastructure form, which allows for the close relationship of the endothelium and blood elements to the neurons they serve, via intervening astrocytes. To focal ischemia, the cerebral microvasculature rapidly displays multiple dynamic responses. Immediate events include breakdown of the primary endothelial cell permeability barrier, with transudation of plasma, expression of endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion receptors, loss of endothelial cell and astrocyte integrin receptors, loss of their matrix ligands, expression of members of several matrix-degrading protease families, and the appearance of receptors associated with angiogenesis and neovascularization. These events occur pari passu with neuron injury. Alterations in the microvessel matrix after the onset of ischemia also suggest links to changes in nonvascular cell viability. Microvascular obstruction within the ischemic territory occurs after occlusion and reperfusion of the feeding arteries ("focal no-reflow" phenomenon). This can result from extrinsic compression and intravascular events, including leukocyte(-platelet) adhesion, platelet-fibrin interactions, and activation of coagulation. All of these events occur in microvessels heterogeneously distributed within the ischemic core. The panorama of acute microvessel responses to focal cerebral ischemia provide opportunities to understand interrelationships between neurons and their microvascular supply and changes that underlie a number of central nervous system neurodegenerative disorders.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes comprise approximately half of the volume of the adult mammalian brain and are the primary neuronal structural and trophic supportive elements. Astrocytes are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains and extend elaborate and dense fine processes that interact intimately with synapses and cerebrovasculature. The recognition in the mid 1990s that astrocytes undergo elevations in intracellular calcium concentration following activation of G protein-coupled receptors by synaptically released neurotransmitters demonstrated not only that astrocytes display a form of excitability but also that astrocytes may be active participants in brain information processing. The roles that astrocytic calcium elevations play in neurophysiology and especially in modulation of neuronal activity have been intensely researched in recent years. This review will summarize the current understanding of the function of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurophysiological processes and discuss areas where the role of astrocytes remains controversial and will therefore benefit from further study. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {The presence or degree of haemodynamic impairment due to occlusive cerebrovascular disease is often inferred from measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and the cerebral rate for oxygen metabolism (CMRO2). However, the relationship of these variables, in particular CBV, to regional cerebral haemodynamics is not clearly established in humans with subacute or chronic disease. In the present study, we investigated the relationship of CBV to OEF, CBF and CMRO2, and to subsequent stroke risk in patients with unilateral carotid artery occlusion, in order to define better the associated haemodynamic and metabolic changes. We reviewed data from 81 patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion enrolled in a prospective study of haemodynamic factors and stroke risk. Measurements of CBV, CBF, OEF and CMRO2 were made on entry using PET. Patients were divided into groups by hemispheric ratios and absolute ipsilateral values of OEF and CBV, based on comparison with normal controls. Haemodynamic and metabolic values, risk factors and stroke risk were compared between groups. Based on hemispheric ratios, 45 patients had increased ipsilateral OEF; CBV was increased in 19 of these 45 patients. No differences in CBF, CMRO2 or clinical risk factors were found between these 19 patients and the remaining 26 patients with increased OEF and normal or reduced CBV. Thirteen ipsilateral strokes occurred during follow-up, and 10 of the 13 occurred in the 19 patients with increased OEF and CBV (log rank P {\textless}0.0001). Thirty-two of the 68 patients with complete quantitative PET data had increased OEF by absolute ipsilateral values. CBV was increased in 20 of the 32 patients. No differences in CBF, CMRO2 or clinical risk factors were found between these 20 patients and the remaining 12 patients with increased OEF and normal CBV. Seven of the nine ipsilateral strokes that occurred in the 68 patients occurred in those 20 patients with increased OEF and increased CBV (log rank P = 0.003). The higher risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with increased OEF and CBV suggests that their degree of haemodynamic compromise is more severe than those with increased OEF and normal CBV. In patients with chronic carotid occlusion and increased OEF, increased CBV may indicate pronounced vasodilation due to exhausted autoregulatory vasodilation. The physiological explanation for the measurement of normal CBV in patients with increased OEF is less certain and may reflect preserved autoregulatory capacity.},

	Abstract = {We sought to determine whether vasopressin V 1a receptor (V 1aR) mRNA detected in cortical astrocytes [Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 45 (1997) 138] was translated into functional receptors by investigating the effector calcium signaling cascade associated with the vasopressin V 1a receptor subtype. Analysis of intracellular calcium dynamics using the calcium-sensitive dye fura-2 AM indicated that exposure of cortical astrocytes to V 1 vasopressin receptor agonist, [Phe 2,Orn 8]-oxytocin, induced a marked dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium which was abolished by depletion of extracellular calcium. V 1 agonist treatment induced a rapid increase in calcium signal in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, which was followed by an accumulation of the calcium signal in the nucleus, suggesting translocation of cytoplasmic calcium into the nucleus. The nuclear calcium signal was sustained for several seconds followed by translocation back to the cytoplasm. Following the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic calcium translocation, total free intracellular calcium concentration decreased. The dynamic calcium cytoplasmic and nuclear localization was confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy coupled with the calcium-sensitive dye fluo-3 AM. To determine the source of calcium, V 1 agonist-induced 45Ca 2+ uptake and [ 3H]IP 1 accumulation were investigated. V 1 agonist induced significant and rapid uptake of 45Ca 2+ and a significant dose-dependent increase in [ 3H]IP 1 accumulation in cortical astrocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of a vasopressin receptor-induced calcium signaling cascade in cortical astrocytes and the first documentation of vasopressin receptor induction of nuclear calcium signaling. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is believed to be involved in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions, including opioid responsivity. Elucidation of the role of NO in the CNS requires the ability to elevate systematically neuronal NO concentrations in vivo. This study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics of L-arginine, a NO precursor, and to relate the disposition of this amino acid to the pharmacodynamic endpoint of neuronal NO production. L-Arginine (250-, 500-, or 1000-mg/kg/h) or saline was infused intravenously for 6 h to rats. L-Arginine was quantified in brain and blood (after in vivo microdialysis) with high-performance liquid chromatography. NO was quantified simultaneously with a sensitive and specific amperometric sensor placed in the hippocampus. The data were fit with a comprehensive pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to obtain parameters governing the systemic disposition of L-arginine, the uptake of L-arginine into the brain, and subsequent NO production. Exogenous administration of L-arginine resulted in incremental elevations in hippocampal NO, with a ∼33, 48, and ∼50{\%} increase from control for the 250-, 500-, and 1000-mg/kg/h L-arginine treated rats, respectively. The PK/PD model, which incorporated known characteristics of the system (saturable uptake of L-arginine into brain; NO production governed by circadian changes in enzyme activity) was capable of describing accurately the observed data. The model developed herein will be invaluable in characterizing the numerous roles of NO in the CNS. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The link between atherosclerosis and regions of disturbed flow and low wall shear stress is now firmly established, but the causal mechanisms underlying the link are not yet understood. It is now recognised that the endothelium is not simply a passive barrier between the blood and the vessel wall, but plays an active role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and participates in the onset of atherosclerosis. Calcium signalling is one of the principal intracellular signalling mechanisms by which endothelial cells (EC) respond to external stimuli, such as fluid shear stress and ligand binding. Previous studies have separately modelled mass transport of chemical species in the bloodstream and calcium dynamics in EC via the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signalling pathway. We review existing models of these two phenomena, before going on to integrate the two components to provide an inclusive new model for the calcium response of the endothelium in an arbitrary vessel geometry. This enables the combined effects of fluid flow and biochemical stimulation on EC to be investigated and is the first time spatially varying, physiological fluid flow-related environmental factors have been combined with intracellular signalling in a mathematical model. Model results show that low endothelial calcium levels in the area of disturbed flow at an arterial widening may be one contributing factor to the onset of vascular disease. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The uptake of 45Ca2+ and the efflux of glutamate or aspartate induced by veratrine or high K+ was blocked (54-76{\%}) by AP7 (IC50 46-250 microM). AP5 and AP4 were less effective. (-)-D888 (10 microM) caused 100{\%} block of evoked 45Ca2+ uptake. Uptake of 45Ca2+ induced by exogenous glutamate, aspartate, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was also inhibited by AP7, whereas GAMS completely blocked the action of kainate and partially blocked that of glutamate. The action of NMDA in stimulating 45Ca2+ uptake was Mg2+-sensitive, low Mg2+ levels in the incubation medium selectively enhancing the response. It is concluded that Ca2+ uptake evoked by excitatory amino acids is receptor-mediated, and that released excitatory amino acids are responsible for a large part of the action of veratrine and high K+ in stimulating 45Ca2+ uptake.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the dominant means of measuring behavior-related neural activity in the human brain. Yet the relation between the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal and underlying neural activity remains an open and actively researched question. A widely accepted model, established for sensory neo-cortex, suggests that the BOLD signal reflects peri-synaptic activity in the form of the local field potential rather than the spiking rate of individual neurons. Several recent experimental results, however, suggest situations in which BOLD, spiking, and the local field potential dissociate. Two different models are discussed, based on the literature reviewed to account for this dissociation, a circuitry-based and vascular-based explanation. Both models are found to account for existing data under some testing situations and in certain brain regions. Because both the vascular and local circuitry-based explanations challenge the BOLD-LFP coupling model, these models provide guidance in predicting when BOLD can be expected to reflect neural processing and when the underlying relation with BOLD may be more complex than a direct correspondence. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes produce a complex repertoire of Ca2+ events that coordinate their major functions. The principle of Ca2+ events integration in astrocytes, however, is unknown. Here we analyze whole Ca2+ events, which were defined as spatiotemporally interconnected transient Ca2+ increases. Using such analysis in single hippocampal astrocytes in culture and in slices we found that spreads and durations of Ca2+ events follow power law distributions, a fingerprint of scale-free systems. A mathematical model demonstrated that such Ca2+ dynamics can arise from intracellular inositol-3-phosphate diffusion. The power law exponent ({\$}\alpha{\$}) was decreased by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) either by specific receptor agonist or by low frequency stimulation of glutamatergic fibers in hippocampal slices. Decrease in {\$}\alpha{\$} indicated an increase in proportion of large Ca2+ events. Notably, mGluRs activation did not increase the frequency of whole Ca2+ events. This result suggests that neuronal activity does not trigger new Ca2+ events in astrocytes (detectable by our methods), but modulates the properties of existing ones. Thus, our results provide a new perspective on how astrocyte responds to neuronal activity by changing its Ca2+ dynamics, which might further affect local network by triggering release of gliotransmitters and by modulating local blood flow.},

	Abstract = {In order to maintain normal brain function, it is critical that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is matched to neuronal metabolic needs. Accordingly, blood flow is increased to areas where neurons are more active (a response termed functional hyperemia). The tight relationships between neuronal activation, glial cell activity, cerebral energy metabolism, and the cerebral vasculature, known as neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling, underpin functional MRI (fMRI) signals but are incompletely understood. As functional imaging techniques, particularly BOLD fMRI, become more widely used, their utility hinges on our ability to accurately and reliably interpret the findings. A growing body of data demonstrates that astrocytes can serve as a "bridge," relaying information on the level of neural activity to blood vessels in order to coordinate oxygen and glucose delivery with the energy demands of the tissue. It is widely assumed that calcium-dependent release of vasoactive substances by astrocytes results in arteriole dilation and the increased blood flow which accompanies neuronal activity. However, the signaling molecules responsible for this communication between astrocytes and blood vessels are yet to be definitively confirmed. Indeed, there is controversy over whether activity-induced changes in astrocyte calcium are widespread and fast enough to elicit such functional hyperemia responses. In this review, I will summarize the evidence which has convincingly demonstrated that astrocytes are able to modify the diameter of cerebral arterioles. I will discuss the prevalence, presence, and timing of stimulus-induced astrocyte calcium transients and describe the evidence for and against the role of calcium-dependent formation and release of vasoactive substances by astrocytes. I will also review alternative mechanisms of astrocyte-evoked changes in arteriole diameter and consider the questions which remain to be answered in this exciting area of research.},

	Abstract = {Local blood flow is modulated in response to changing patterns of neuronal activity (Roy and Sherrington, 1890), a process termed neurovascular coupling. It has been proposed that the central cellular pathway driving this process is astrocytic Gq-GPCR-linked IP3R-dependent Ca(2+) signaling, though in vivo tests of this hypothesis are largely lacking. We examined the impact of astrocytic Gq-GPCR and IP3R-dependent Ca(2+) signaling on cortical blood flow in awake, lightly sedated, responsive mice using multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy and novel genetic tools that enable the selective manipulation of astrocytic signaling pathways in vivo. Selective stimulation of astrocytic Gq-GPCR cascades and downstream Ca(2+) signaling with the hM3Dq DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) designer receptor system was insufficient to modulate basal cortical blood flow. We found no evidence of observable astrocyte endfeet Ca(2+) elevations following physiological visual stimulation despite robust dilations of adjacent arterioles using cyto-GCaMP3 and Lck-GCaMP6s, the most sensitive Ca(2+) indicator available. Astrocytic Ca(2+) elevations could be evoked when inducing the startle response with unexpected air puffs. However, startle-induced astrocytic Ca(2+) signals did not precede corresponding startle-induced hemodynamic changes. Further, neurovascular coupling was intact in lightly sedated, responsive mice genetically lacking astrocytic IP3R-dependent Ca(2+) signaling (IP3R2 KO). These data demonstrate that astrocytic Gq-GPCR-linked IP3R-dependent Ca(2+) signaling does not mediate neurovascular coupling in visual cortex of awake, lightly sedated, responsive mice.},

	Abstract = {Spreading depolarization (SD) is a slowly propagating wave of near complete depolarizations of neurons and glia. Previous studies have reported large GABA releases during SD, but there is limited understanding of how GABA release and receptor activation are regulated and influence the propagating SD wavefront, as well as an excitatory phase immediately following the passage of SD. The present study characterized GABA-A type receptor (GABAAR) currents during SD generated by KCl microinjection in acute hippocampal slices from adult mice. Spontaneous GABAAR-mediated currents (sIPSCs) were initially enhanced, and were followed by a large outward current at the wavefront. sIPSC were then transiently supressed during the late SD phase, resulting in a significant reduction of the sIPSC/sEPSC ratio. The large outward current generated during SD was eliminated by the GABAAR antagonist gabazine, but the channel potentiator/agonist propofol failed to potentiate the current, likely because of a ceiling effect. Extracellular Cl- decreases recorded during SD were reduced by the antagonist but were not increased by the potentiator. Together with effects of GABAAR modulators on SD propagation rate, these results demonstrate a significant inhibitory role of the initial GABAAR activation and suggest that intracellular Cl- loading is insufficient to generate excitatory GABAAR responses during SD propagation. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for facilitating effects of GABAAR antagonists, and the lack of inhibitory effect of GABAAR potentiators on SD propagation. In addition, selective suppression of GABA transmission in the late SD period and the lack of effect of GABAA modulators on the duration of SD suggests that GABA modulation may not be effective approach to protect neurons during the vulnerable phase of SD.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed distinct patterns of cortical atrophy and hypoperfusion in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between these in vivo imaging measures and the corresponding underlying pathophysiological changes, however, remains elusive. Recently, attention has turned to neuroimaging of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in which imaging-pathological correlations can be readily performed. In this study, anatomical and arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging scans of amyloid precursor protein transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice were acquired at 3, 12, and 18 months of age. Fully-automated image processing methods were used to derive quantitative measures of cortical thickness and perfusion. These studies revealed increased regional cortical thickness in young transgenic mice relative to age-matched wild-type mice. However, the transgenic mice generally demonstrated a greater rate of cortical thinning over 15 months. Cortical perfusion was significantly reduced in young transgenic mice in comparison with wild-type mice across most brain regions. Previously unreported regional genotype differences and age-related changes in cortical thickness and cerebral perfusion were identified in amyloid precursor protein transgenic and wild-type mice. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Synapses display remarkable alterations in strength during repetitive use. Different types of synapses exhibit distinctive synaptic plasticity, but the factors giving rise to such diversity are not fully understood. To provide the experimental basis for a general model of short-term plasticity, we studied three synapses in rat brain slices at 34 degrees C: the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, and the Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. These synapses exhibited a broad range of responses to regular and Poisson stimulus trains. Depression dominated at the climbing fiber synapse, facilitation was prominent at the parallel fiber synapse, and both depression and facilitation were apparent in the Schaffer collateral synapse. These synapses were modeled by incorporating mechanisms of short-term plasticity that are known to be driven by residual presynaptic calcium (Ca(res)). In our model, release is the product of two factors: facilitation and refractory depression. Facilitation is caused by a calcium-dependent increase in the probability of release. Refractory depression is a consequence of release sites becoming transiently ineffective after release. These sites recover with a time course that is accelerated by elevations of Ca(res). Facilitation and refractory depression are coupled by their common dependence on Ca(res) and because increased transmitter release leads to greater synaptic depression. This model captures the behavior of three different synapses for various stimulus conditions. The interplay of facilitation and depression dictates synaptic strength and variability during repetitive activation. The resulting synaptic plasticity transforms the timing of presynaptic spikes into varying postsynaptic response amplitudes.},

Single-channel openings of hemichannels (530 picosiemens) were observed in OGD. Both the current and dye flux were blocked by inhibitors of hemichannels.

	Abstract = {Cell-cell communication in astroglial syncytia is mediated by intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses elicited by extracellular signaling molecules as well as by diverse physical and chemical stimuli. Despite the evidence that astrocytic swelling promotes [Ca(2+)](i) elevation through Ca(2+) influx, the molecular identity of the channel protein underlying this response is still elusive. Here we report that primary cultured cortical astrocytes express the transient receptor potential vanilloid-related channel 4 (TRPV 4), a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel gated by a variety of stimuli, including cell swelling. Immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses confirmed the presence of the channel protein and its localization in the plasma membrane. TRPV4 was functional because the selective TRPV4 agonist 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD) activated an outwardly rectifying cation current with biophysical and pharmacological properties that overlapped those of recombinant human TRPV4 expressed in COS cells. Moreover, 4alphaPDD and hypotonic challenge promoted [Ca(2+)](i) elevation mediated by influx of extracellular Ca(2+). This effect was abolished by low micromolar concentration of the TRPV4 inhibitor Ruthenium Red. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy of rat brain revealed that TRPV4 was enriched in astrocytic processes of the superficial layers of the neocortex and in astrocyte end feet facing pia and blood vessels. Collectively, these data indicate that cultured cortical astroglia express functional TRPV4 channels. They also demonstrate that TRPV4 is particularly abundant in astrocytic membranes at the interface between brain and extracerebral liquid spaces. Consistent with its roles in other tissues, these results support the view that TRPV4 might participate in astroglial osmosensation and thus play a key role in brain volume homeostasis.},

@article{Du2015,
	Abstract = {The classical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) implies that activity-dependent axonal glutamate release at synapses evokes the production and release of vasoactive signals from both neurons and astrocytes, which dilate arterioles, increasing in turn cerebral blood flow (CBF) to areas with increased metabolic needs. However, whether this model is applicable to brain areas that also use less conven-tional neurotransmitters, such as neuropeptides, is currently unknown. To this end, we studied NVC in the rat hypothalamic magnocel-lular neurosecretory system (MNS) of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), in which dendritic release of neuropeptides, including vasopressin (VP), constitutes a key signaling modality influencing neuronal and network activity. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we investi-gated vasopressin-mediated vascular responses in SON arterioles of hypothalamic brain slices of Wistar or VP-eGFP Wistar rats. Bath-applied VP significantly constricted SON arterioles (⌬Ϫ41 Ϯ 7{\%}) via activation of the V1a receptor subtype. Vasoconstrictions were also observed in response to single VP neuronal stimulation (⌬Ϫ18 Ϯ 2{\%}), an effect prevented by V1a receptor blockade (V2255), supporting local dendritic VP release as the key signal mediating activity-dependent vasoconstrictions. Conversely, osmotically driven magnocellu-lar neurosecretory neuronal population activity leads to a predominant nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation (⌬19 Ϯ 2{\%}). Activity-dependent vasodilations were followed by a VP-mediated vasoconstriction, which acted to limit the magnitude of the vasodilation and served to reset vascular tone following activity-dependent vasodilation. Together, our results unveiled a unique and complex form of NVC in the MNS, supporting a competitive balance between nitric oxide and activity-dependent dendritic released VP, in the generation of proper NVC responses.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic adjustments to neuronal energy supply in response to synaptic activity are critical for neuronal function. Glial cells known as astrocytes have processes that ensheath most central synapses and express G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors and transporters that respond to neuronal activity. Astrocytes also release substrates for neuronal oxidative phosphorylation and have processes that terminate on the surface of brain arterioles and can influence vascular smooth muscle tone and local blood flow. Membrane receptor or transporter-mediated effects of glutamate represent a convergence point of astrocyte influence on neuronal bioenergetics. Astrocytic glutamate uptake drives glycolysis and subsequent shuttling of lactate from astrocytes to neurons for oxidative metabolism. Astrocytes also convert synaptically reclaimed glutamate to glutamine, which is returned to neurons for glutamate salvage or oxidation. Finally, astrocytes store brain energy currency in the form of glycogen, which can be mobilized to produce lactate for neuronal oxidative phosphorylation in response to glutamatergic neurotransmission. These mechanisms couple synaptically driven astrocytic responses to glutamate with release of energy substrates back to neurons to match demand with supply. In addition, astrocytes directly influence the tone of penetrating brain arterioles in response to glutamatergic neurotransmission, coordinating dynamic regulation of local blood flow. We will describe the role of astrocytes in neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling in detail and discuss, in turn, how astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to neuronal bioenergetic deficit and neurodegeneration. Understanding the role of astrocytes as a hub for neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling mechanisms is a critical underpinning for therapeutic development in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by chronic generalized brain ischemia and brain microvascular dysfunction. },

	Abstract = {Nitrite signaling likely occurs through its reduction to nitric oxide (NO). Several reports support a role of erythrocytes and hemoglobin in nitrite reduction, but this remains controversial, and alternative reductive pathways have been proposed. In this work we determined whether the primary human erythrocytic nitrite reductase is hemoglobin as opposed to other erythrocytic proteins that have been suggested to be the major source of nitrite reduction. We employed several different assays to determine NO production from nitrite in erythrocytes including electron paramagnetic resonance detection of nitrosyl hemoglobin, chemiluminescent detection of NO, and inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation. Our studies show that NO is formed by red blood cells and inhibits platelet activation. Nitric oxide formation and signaling can be recapitulated with isolated deoxyhemoglobin. Importantly, there is limited NO production from erythrocytic xanthine oxidoreductase and nitric-oxide synthase. Under certain conditions we find dorzolamide (an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase) results in diminished nitrite bioactivation, but the role of carbonic anhydrase is abrogated when physiological concentrations of CO2 are present. Importantly, carbon monoxide, which inhibits hemoglobin function as a nitrite reductase, abolishes nitrite bioactivation. Overall our data suggest that deoxyhemoglobin is the primary erythrocytic nitrite reductase operating under physiological conditions and accounts for nitrite-mediated NO signaling in blood.},

Activation of NMDA receptors in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus by paired and multiple stimuli occurred here with orthodromic stimulation at 10 Hz. Elevating extracellular potassium ion concentration ([K+]o) to 7.5 mM selectively enhanced the NMDA receptor-mediated component of the response to repetitive stimulation, and led to burst-firing of pyramidal cells. The effects of elevated [K+]o on NMDA receptor activation were accompanied by relatively small changes in resting potential, however, and may in part result from a decrease in the potassium equilibrium potential producing slowed repolarization. Supporting this hypothesis, low concentrations of the K+-channel blocker tetraethylammonium added to normal [K+]o solution slowed repolarization and reproduced the effects of elevated [K+]o on NMDA receptor activation. Significant changes in [K+]o occur with neuronal activity in the central nervous system, and thus may play a role in regulating NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic activity. ?? 1990.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study the operational organization of the human brain, but the exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.},

	Abstract = {A successfully developed enzyme-based lactate microsensor with rapid response time allows the direct and continuous in vivo measurement of lactic acid concentration with high temporal resolution in brain extracellular fluid. The fluctuations coupled to neuronal activity in extracellular lactate concentration were explored in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the rat brain after electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway. Extracellular glucose and oxygen levels were also detected simultaneously by coimplantation of a fast-response glucose sensor and an oxygen electrode, to provide novel information of trafficking of energy substances in real time related to local neuronal activity. The results first give a comprehensive picture of complementary energy supply and use of lactate and glucose in the intact brain tissue. In response to acute neuronal activation, the brain tissue shifts immediately to significant energy supply by lactate. A local temporary fuel "reservoir" is established behind the blood-brain barrier, evidenced by increased extracellular lactate concentration. The pool can be depleted rapidly, up to 28{\%} in 10-12 s, by massive, acute neuronal use after stimulation and can be replenished in approximately 20 s. Glutamate-stimulated astrocytic glycolysis and the increase of regional blood flow may regulate the lactate concentration of the pool in different time scales to maintain local energy homeostasis.},

	Abstract = {Calcium signaling in C6 glioma cells in culture was examined with digital fluorescence video microscopy. C6 cells express low levels of the gap junction protein connexin43 and have correspondingly weak gap junctional communication as evidenced by dye coupling (Naus, C. C. G., J. F. Bechberger, S. Caveney, and J. X. Wilson. 1991. Neurosci. Lett. 126:33-36). Transfection of C6 cells with the cDNA encoding connexin43 resulted in clones with increased expression of connexin43 mRNA and protein and increased dye coupling, as well as markedly reduced rates of proliferation (Zhu, D., S. Caveney, G. M. Kidder, and C. C. Naus. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:1883-1887; Naus, C. C. G., D. Zhu, S. Todd, and G. M. Kidder. 1992. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 12:163-175). Mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a culture of non-transfected C6 cells induced a wave of increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that showed little or no communication to adjacent cells. By contrast, mechanical stimulation of a single cell in cultures of C6 clones expressing transfected connexin43 cDNA induced a Ca2+ wave that was communicated to multiple surrounding cells, and the extent of communication was proportional to the level of expression of the connexin43 cDNA. These results provide direct evidence that intercellular Ca2+ signaling occurs via gap junctions. Ca2+ signaling through gap junctions may provide a means for the coordinated regulation of cellular function, including cell growth and differentiation.},

	Abstract = {1. The resting membrane potentials of proximal and distal segments of the arterioles which arise from the rat middle cerebral artery were determined. Proximal segments had stable membrane potentials with a mean value of -69 mV. The membrane potentials of distal segments were less negative and often unstable. 2. When the extracellular concentration of potassium ions [( K+]o) was increased proximal segments of arteriole were depolarized whereas distal ones were hyperpolarized. When [K+]o was decreased both proximal and distal segments were depolarized, the changes being more marked in proximal arterioles. 3. The membranes of proximal segments of arteriole displayed inward rectification at potentials near rest; inward rectification in distal segments of arteriole, when detected, was less pronounced. 4. The activation curve for inward rectification in proximal segments of arteriole was changed by changing the extracellular concentration of K+. A reduction in [K+]o caused the activation curve to move to such negative potentials that the inward rectifier no longer contributed to the resting conductance. 5. Increasing [K+]o changed the activation curve for inward rectification in distal segments of arteriole so that more K+ current flowed at potentials near resting. At the same time the membrane potential hyperpolarized. 6. The results are discussed in relation to autoregulatory changes which occur following changes in the K+ concentration of cerebrospinal fluid},

	Abstract = {Spreading depression (SD) was studied with intracellular and extracellular recordings and with photometry in slices of rat hippocampus. Repetitive electrical stimulation could initiate SD in either normal medium or in low-Ca2+ medium containing Mn2+, especially during transient hypoxia. The extracellular voltage near CA1 pyramidal somata and dendrites became negative by approximately 18 mV during SD. This negativity peaked more slowly in low-Ca2+ medium containing Mn2+. The wave of negativity propagated across the slice in both media at approximately 6 mm/min. Input resistance of pyramidal neurons became undetectable during SD, and differential voltage recording between neurons and adjacent extracellular space demonstrated that transmembrane potential approached zero. Slices became more opaque during SD. Photometry revealed approximately 10{\%} increase in reflectance and a similar decrease in transmittance of white light, which occurred with a time course similar to the extracellularly recorded voltage shift. These data support the hypothesis that SD represents a large increase in membrane permeability associated with substantial movements of water. The persistance of SD in a bathing solution that blocked electrically evoked postsynaptic potentials suggests that the contribution of synaptic transmitter release to the propagation of SD should be reappraised.},

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show emotional-cognitive disturbances, which have been associated with alterations within the default-mode network. However, it remains unclear whether these default-mode network alterations are related to abnormalities in NBRs. We therefore investigated neural activity in the default-mode network during different emotional tasks in patients with MDD in an event-related fMRI design. MDD patients showed significantly reduced NBRs in several regions of the default-mode network. Decreased NBRs in MDD patients correlated with depression severity and feelings of hopelessness. In sum, our findings demonstrate that default-mode network NBRs are reduced in MDD and modulate these patients' abnormally negative emotions.},

	Abstract = {Increased total plasma homocysteine (t-Hcy) levels are found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene encodes a key enzyme that influences the metabolism of homocysteine, it has been considered as a possible genetic risk factor for AD. Although the MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism has a significant impact on reducing enzyme activity and increasing t-Hcy concentrations, the association between the C677T polymorphism and AD remains inconclusive. To determine whether the MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism contributes to the risk for late-onset AD (LOAD) in Chinese, we have investigated 104 sporadic LOAD patients and 130 healthy controls. The strong associations of the TT genotype and T-allele with LOAD (p 0.001, OR 5.73 95{\%} CI 1.85-17.72, and p 0.002, OR 1.89 95{\%} CI 1.25-2.86) were found. After stratifying by apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE epsilon4) status, increased LOAD risks associated with the TT genotype only in the APOE epsilon4 noncarriers (chi2=8.92, df=1, p=0.003) and with the T-allele in either group (chi2=5.18, df=1, p=0.023 and chi2=5.53, df=1, p=0.019) were seen. These results suggest that as an APOE epsilon4 allele-dependent risk factor, the MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism is involved in developing LOAD in Chinese.},

A non-dimensional representation of "autoregulation" coupled with an asymmetric binary tree algorithm has been developed. The tree has a defined topology as well as a spatial representation in 3D. An analysis using a simple linearization shows the systems dynamics when perturbed away from equilibrium. Results, based on previously published work by Karch and Schreiner are presented for a variety of parameters which provide different shapes of the tree and indicate a possible mechanism for "growing" the tree in specified directions. In addition the tree, through the use of local tagging has the ability to vary its size locally via a coupled set of conservation and reverting differential equations. {\textcopyright}2010 IMACS.

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is widely used in the nervous system. With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation of calcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal NO signaling could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.},

	Abstract = {1. We constructed a branching dendritic compartmental model of a CA3 pyramidal neurone, using experimental data from guinea-pig and rat cells obtained in vitro. The goal was to understand interactions between synaptic events impinging on dendritic branches and voltage- and calcium-dependent currents. The model contained sixty-four soma-dendrite (SD) compartments, an axon initial segment (IS), and four axonal compartments. There were six active conductances in the SD membrane, including a sodium conductance (gNa) and a high-threshold calcium conductance (gCa), with kinetic properties similar to those reported in a previous study. 2. The distribution of conductance densities across the IS and SD was adjusted by testing the model response to antidromic stimulation and current pulses or sustained currents injected into the soma or apical dendrites. As before, gNa was concentrated on and near the soma with lower density in the dendrites, while gCa had a higher density in apical dendrites than at the soma. 3. The model predicts that CA3 pyramidal neurones in media blocking synaptic transmission should fire a burst of action potentials following antidromic stimulation. This was confirmed experimentally in hippocampal slices. 4. Both in the model and in guinea-pig neurones, dendritic IPSCs can delay the onset of bursting. If an IPSC begins soon enough after the first fast action potential, the later burst envelope is attenuated. This effect results from suppression of dendritic Ca2+ electrogenesis. 5. The model predicts that an appropriately timed dendritic IPSC (after the first somatic spike but before the dendritic Ca2+ spike) may suppress the transient local [Ca2+] signal, while having a negligible effect on the electrical output of the neurone. This phenomenon has been reported in guinea-pig Purkinje cells. 6. We conclude that active dendritic currents are critical for regulation of the electrical output of CA3 pyramidal neurones. We suggest also that dendritic [Ca2+] signals might be controlled in individual dendrites independently of action potential outputs, an effect of possible importance for synaptic plasticity.},

Incubation for 18 h produced 25{\%} inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase activity. NADH-ubiquinone-1 reductase (complex I) and succinate-cytochrome c reductase (complex II-III) activities were not affected. Prolonged incubation for 36 h gave rise to a 56{\%} reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity and a 35{\%} reduction in succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity, but NADH-ubiquinone-1 reductase activity was unchanged. Citrate synthase activity was not affected by any of these conditions. The inhibition of the activities of these mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes was prevented by incubation in the presence of the specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. The lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma treatment of the astrocytes produced an increase in glycolysis and lactate formation. These results suggest that inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain after induction of astrocytic nitric oxide synthase may represent a mechanism for nitric oxide-mediated neurotoxicity.},

	Abstract = {Although spiral waves are ubiquitous features of nature and have been observed in many biological systems, their existence and potential function in mammalian cerebral cortex remain uncertain. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that spiral waves occur frequently in the neocortex in vivo, both during pharmacologically induced oscillations and during sleep-like states. While their life span is limited, spiral waves can modify ongoing cortical activity by influencing oscillation frequencies and spatial coherence and by reducing amplitude in the area surrounding the spiral phase singularity. During sleep-like states, the rate of occurrence of spiral waves varies greatly depending on brain states. These results support the hypothesis that spiral waves, as an emergent activity pattern, can organize and modulate cortical population activity on the mesoscopic scale and may contribute to both normal cortical processing and to pathological patterns of activity such as those found in epilepsy.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in neurohormonal secretion from median eminence neuroendocrine nerve terminals. We report that stimulation of NO release from median eminence fragments including vascular tissues occurs by $\mu$3 receptor activation by morphine, or by cannabinoid type 1 receptor activation by anandamide. The released levels of NO are lower after anandamide than after morphine stimulation. These processes can be blocked by L-NAME, a specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, by naloxone for the morphine-stimulated NO release, or SR 141716A, a specific CB1 receptor inhibitor, for the anandamide-stimulated NO release. Furthermore, morphine and anandamide, by this NO dependent process, influences neurohormonal release from median eminence nerve terminals within 10 min. Via this NO dependent process, morphine stimulates both GnRH and CRF release, whereas anandamide selectively stimulates GnRH release. These observations together with previous data suggest that morphine and the anandamide-stimulated NO originates from the vascular endothelium of the portal plexus. These results indicate that endothelial cells of the median eminence may be involved in the release of neurohormones.},

	Abstract = {Pathophysiology of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is commonly seen in neurological diseases. The typical features of NVU pathophysiology include tissue hypoxia, inflammatory and angiogenic activation, as well as initiation of complex molecular interactions between cellular (brain endothelial cells, astroctyes, pericytes, inflammatory cells, and neurons) and acellular (basal lamina) components of the NVU, jointly resulting in increased blood--brain barrier permeability, brain edema, neurovascular uncoupling, and neuronal dysfunction and damage. The evidence of important role of the brain vascular compartment in disease pathogenesis has elicited the debate whether the primary vascular events may be a cause of the neurological disease, as opposed to a mere participant recruited by a primary neuronal origin of pathology? Whereas some hereditary and acquired cerebral angiopathies could be considered a primary cause of neurological symptoms of the disease, the epidemiological studies showing a high degree of comorbidity among vascular disease and dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as migraine and epilepsy, suggested that primary vascular pathology may be etiological factor causing neuronal dysfunction or degeneration in these diseases. This review focuses on recent hypotheses and evidence, suggesting that pathophysiology of the NVU may be initiating trigger for neuronal pathology and subsequent neurological manifestations of the disease.},

Here, using cytosolic and membrane-tethered forms of genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators (GECIs; cyto-GCaMP3 and Lck-GCaMP3), we report well-characterized approaches that overcome these limitations. We used in vivo microinjections of adeno-associated viruses to express GECIs in astrocytes and studied Ca(2+) signals in acute hippocampal slices in vitro from adult mice (aged ∼P80) two weeks after infection. Our data reveal a sparkling panorama of unexpectedly numerous, frequent, equivalently scaled, and highly localized Ca(2+) microdomains within entire astrocyte territories in situ within acute hippocampal slices, consistent with the distribution of perisynaptic branchlets described using electron microscopy. Signals from endfeet were revealed with particular clarity. The tools and experimental approaches we describe in detail allow for the systematic study of Ca(2+) signals within entire astrocytes, including within fine perisynaptic branchlets and vessel-associated endfeet, permitting rigorous evaluation of how astrocytes contribute to brain function.},

	Abstract = {We used two-photon (2-p) F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy to provide serial, noninvasive measurements of [Ca(2+)] in arterioles of living "biosensor" mice. These express a genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicator (GECI), either FRET-based exMLCK or intensity-based GCaMP2. The FRET ratios, Rmin and Rmax, required for in vivo Ca(2+) calibration of exMLCK were obtained in isolated arteries. For in vivo experiments, mice were anesthetized (1.5{\%} isoflurane), and arterioles within a depilated ear were visualized through the intact skin (i.e., noninvasively), by 2-p excitation of exMLCK (at 820 nm) or GCaMP2 (at 920 nm). Spontaneous or agonist-evoked [Ca(2+)] transients in arteriolar smooth muscle cells were imaged (at 2 Hz) with both exMLCK and GCaMP2. To examine changes in arteriolar [Ca(2+)] that might accompany hypertension, five exMLCK mice were implanted with telemetric blood pressure transducers and osmotic minipumps containing ANG II (350 ng{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1){\textperiodcentered}min(-1)) and fed a high (6{\%})-salt diet for 9 days. [Ca(2+)] was measured every other day in five smooth muscle cells of two to three arterioles in each animal. Prior to ANG II/salt, [Ca(2+)] was 246 $\pm$ 42 nM. [Ca(2+)] increased transiently to 599 nM on day 2 after beginning ANG II/salt, then remained elevated at 331 $\pm$ 42 nM for 4 more days, before returning to 265 $\pm$ 47 nM 6 days after removal of ANG II/salt. In summary, two-photon excitation of exMLCK and GCaMP2 provides a method for noninvasive, longitudinal quantification of [Ca(2+)] dynamics and vascular structure in individual arterioles of a particular animal over an extended period of time, a capability that should enhance future studies of hypertension and vascular function.},

	Abstract = {Connexins have been hypothesized to play an important role in intercellular communication within the vascular wall and may provide a mechanistic explanation for conduction of vasomotor responses. To test this hypothesis, we studied the transmission of vasomotor responses in the intact skeletal muscle microcirculation of connexin40-deficient mice (Cx40(-/-)). Arterioles were locally stimulated with hyperpolarizing dilators (acetylcholine [ACh] as well as bradykinin [Bk]) or depolarizing K(+) solution, and the resulting changes in diameter were measured using a videomicroscopy technique at the site of application and up to 1.32 mm upstream. Arterial pressure was elevated 25{\%} in Cx40(-/-) mice (94+/-5 versus 75+/-4 mm Hg). Vessels selected for study had equivalent basal diameter and vasomotor tone in both genotypes of mice. Vasomotion was present in small arterioles of both genotypes, but its intensity was exaggerated in Cx40(-/-) mice. ACh and Bk induced dilation (33{\%} and 53{\%}, respectively, of maximal response) at the site of application that was of similar magnitude in both genotypes. These dilations were observed to spread upstream within {\textless}1 second without significant attenuation in Cx40(+/+) mice. However, spreading was severely attenuated in Cx40(-/-) animals (11+/-4{\%} versus 35+/-7{\%} with ACh and 38+/-5{\%} versus 60+/-7{\%} with Bk in Cx40(-/-) and Cx40(+/+), respectively; P{\textless}0.05). In contrast, conducted vasoconstrictions, induced by K(+) solution decreased equally with distance in both genotypes. These results support a significant role for Cx40 in vascular intercellular communication. Our observations indicate that Cx40 is required for normal transmission of endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses and may underlie altered vasomotion patterns.},

	Abstract = {Phenylephrine induces endothelium-independent rhythmic contractions in ryanodinetreated rabbit mesenteric arteries. To elucidate the ionic mechanism of this rhythmic behaviour, rabbit mesenteric arterial rings were suspended in an organ chamber for isometric tension studies. Yohimbine, propranolol, and atropine had no effect on these contractions, minimizing the possibility that transmitter release from nerve terminals was involved. Additionally, the oscillatory contractions were not altered by diphenhydramine, cimetidine, and indomethacin, thus ruling out the involvement of histamine and prostaglandins. This oscillatory response was completely abolished after the removal of extracellular Ca 2+, as well as after Ca 2+ channel blockade by diltiazem or nifedipine. Sparteine and quinidine, Ca 2+-activated K+ channel antagonists, also abolished the oscillation. In contrast, tetraethylammonium and 3,4-diaminopyridine, voltage-dependent K+ channel antagonists, augmented the response. Glibenclamide, an antagonist of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, had no effect on the rhythmic contractions. These results suggest that the rhythmic contractions observed in rabbit mesenteric arteries after ryanodine treatment were caused by the movement of Ca 2+ and K+ across the plasmalemma via the voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channel and the Ca 2+-activated K+ channel, respectively.},

	Abstract = {This study was undertaken to examine the effect of increasing transmural pressure on membrane electrical properties of cat middle cerebral arterial muscle. Middle cerebral arteries were removed from the cat brain, cannulated, and prepared so that transmural pressure within a segment could be manipulated. Intracellular membrane potential was recorded with glass microelectrodes at various transmural pressures. There was a positive slope relating changes in intracellular membrane potential as a function of transmural pressure with a correlation coefficient of 0.79. Blockade of nerve excitation with tetrodotoxin and inhibition of alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine not only did not block the pressure-induced depolarization, but increased the slope of the intracellular membrane potential vs. pressure relationship. This slope was increased upon elevation of extracellular calcium concentration from 2.5 to 4.0 mM and was significantly reduced upon reduction of extracellular calcium concentration to 0.5 mM. When arterial preparations were equilibrated at 0 mm Hg prior to pressurization, action potentials were recorded only when pressure was initially elevated, while a sustained depolarization was recorded during the pressure plateau. However, when arteries were equilibrated at a transmural pressure of 100 mm Hg for 90 minutes, spontaneous action potentials were recorded which increased in frequency as a function of pressure until they were inactivated when intracellular membrane potential approached -30 mV at high transmural pressures. Photomicrographs demonstrated that these vessels either maintained or decreased diameter upon pressurization. These findings provide a cellular mechanism for myogenic regulation of cerebral arterial diameter.},

	Abstract = {An understanding of the rate of reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with oxygen in aqueous solutions is needed in assessing the various actions of NO in the body. A novel approach was developed for studying the kinetics of this reaction, which permitted simultaneous and continuous measurements of the concentrations of NO and the principal product, nitrite (NO2-). Nitric oxide was measured using a chemiluminescence detector, with continuous sampling achieved by diffusion of NO through a membrane fitted into the base of a small, stirred reactor. The results with various initial NO and 0 2 concentrations confirmed that the rate of reaction is second-order in NO and first-order in 0 2 . The rate of reaction of NO was described by the expression 4kl [N0I2[O2], where kl was (2.1 f 0.4) X lo6 M-2 s-1 a t 23 O C and (2.4 f 0.3) X lo6 M-2 s-l a t 37 "C. The value of kl was the same at p H 4.9 and 7.4. The rate of formation of NO2-equaled the rate of reaction of NO (within experimental uncertainty of a few percent), and there was no detectable formation of nitrate (Nos-). This confirmed that NO and NO2-were the only NO, species present in significant amounts and supported the validity of pseudo-steady-state assumptions for NO2 and N2O3, which are intermediates in the conversion of NO to NOa-. A kinetic model was developed to predict temporal variations in the concentrations of NO, 02, NOz-, NO2, and N2O3 in the system studied, which were due in part to transport across the gas-liquid interface and across the membrane a t the base of the reactor. The analysis emphasizes the importance of quantifying interphase mass transfer when studying reaction rates in open systems, a point which has not always been recognized in previous studies with nitric oxide.},

	Abstract = {Arterial pressure is a cyclic phenomenon characterized by a pressure wave oscillating around the mean blood pressure, from diastolic to systolic blood pressure, defining the pulse pressure. Aortic input impedance is a measure of the opposition of the circulation to an oscillatory flow input (stroke volume generated by heart work). Aortic input impedance integrates factors opposing LV ejection, such as peripheral resistance, viscoelastic properties and dimensions of the large central arteries, and the intensity and timing of the pressure wave reflections, associated with the opposition to LV ejection influenced by inertial forces. The two most frequently used methods of arterial stiffness are measurement of PWV and central (aortic or common carotid artery) pulse wave analysis, recorded directly at the carotid artery or indirectly in the ascending aorta from radial artery pressure curve. The arterial system is heterogenous and characterized by the existence of a stiffness gradient with progressive stiffness increase (PWV) from ascending aorta and large elastic proximal arteries to the peripheral muscular conduit arteries. Analysis of aortic or carotid pressure waveform and amplitude concerns the effect of reflected waves on pressure shape and amplitude, estimated in absolute terms, augmented pressure in millimetre of mercury, or, in relative terms, 'augmentation index' (Aix in percentage of pulse pressure). Finally, if the aortic PWV has the highest predictive value for prognosis, the aortic or central artery pressure waveform should be recorded and analysed in parallel with the measure of PWV to allow a deeper analysis of arterial haemodynamics.},

	Abstract = {Vasomotion is a rhythmic variation in microvascular diameter. Although known for more than 150 years, the cellular processes underlying the initiation of vasomotion are not fully understood. In the present study a model of a single cell is extended by coupling a number of cells into a tube. The simulated results point to a permissive role of cGMP in establishing intercellular synchronization. In sufficient concentration, cGMP may activate a cGMP-sensitive calcium-dependent chloride channel, causing a tight spatiotemporal coupling between release of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium, membrane depolarization, and influx of extracellular calcium. Low [cGMP] is associated only with unsynchronized waves. At intermediate concentrations, cells display either waves or whole cell oscillations, but these remain unsynchronized between cells. Whole cell oscillations are associated with rhythmic variation in membrane potential and flow of current through gap junctions. The amplitude of these oscillations in potential grows with increasing [cGMP], and, past a certain threshold, they become strong enough to entrain all cells in the vascular wall, thereby initiating sustained vasomotion. In this state there is a rhythmic flow of calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels into the cytoplasm, making the frequency of established vasomotion sensitive to membrane potential. It is concluded that electrical coupling through gap junctions is likely to be responsible for the rapid synchronization across a large number of cells. Gap-junctional current between cells is due to the appearance of oscillations in the membrane potential that again depends on the entrainment of sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane within the individual cell.},

	Abstract = {The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and Stewart's strong ion model are currently used to describe mammalian acid-base equilibria. Anomalies exist when the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is applied to plasma, whereas the strong ion model does not provide a practical method for determining the total plasma concentration of nonvolatile weak acids (Atot) and the effective dissociation constant for plasma weak acids (Ka). A simplified strong ion model, which was developed from the assumption that plasma ions act as strong ions, volatile buffer ions (HCO-3), or nonvolatile buffer ions, indicates that plasma pH is determined by five independent variables: PCO2, strong ion difference, concentration of individual nonvolatile plasma buffers (albumin, globulin, and phosphate), ionic strength, and temperature. The simplified strong ion model conveys on a fundamental level the mechanism for change in acid-base status, explains many of the anomalies when the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is applied to plasma, is conceptually and algebraically simpler than Stewart's strong ion model, and provides a practical in vitro method for determining Atot and Ka of plasma. Application of the simplified strong ion model to CO2-tonometered horse plasma produced values for Atot (15.0 3.1 meq/l) and Ka (2.22 0.32 x 10(-7) eq/l) that were significantly different from the values commonly assumed for human plasma (Atot = 20.0 meq/l, Ka = 3.0 x 10(-7) eq/l). Moreover, application of the experimentally determined values for Atot and Ka to published data for the horse (known PCO2, strong ion difference, and plasma protein concentration) predicted plasma pH more accurately than the values for Atot and Ka commonly assumed for human plasma. Species-specific values for Atot and Ka should be experimentally determined when the simplified strong ion model (or strong ion model) is used to describe acid-base equilibria.},

	Abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is associated with a dramatic failure of brain ion homeostasis and increased energy metabolism. There is strong clinical and experimental evidence to suggest that CSD is the mechanism of migraine, and involved in progressive neuronal injury in stroke and head trauma. Here we tested the hypothesis that single episodes of CSD induced acute hypoxia, and prolonged impairment of neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling. Cortical spreading depression was induced in rat frontal cortex, whereas cortical electrical activity and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded by glass microelectrodes, cerebral blood flow (CBF) by laser-Doppler flowmetry, and tissue oxygen tension (tpO(2)) with polarographic microelectrodes. Cortical spreading depression increased cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) by 71{\%}+/-6.7{\%} and CBF by 238{\%}+/-48.1{\%} for 1 to 2 mins. For the following 2 h, basal tpO(2) and CBF were reduced whereas basal CMRO(2) was persistently elevated by 8.1{\%}+/-2.9{\%}. In addition, within first hour after CSD we found impaired neurovascular coupling (LFP versus CBF), whereas neurometabolic coupling (LFP versus CMRO(2)) remained unaffected. Impaired neurovascular coupling was explained by both reduced vascular reactivity and suppressed function of cortical inhibitory interneurons. The protracted effects of CSD on basal CMRO(2) and neurovascular coupling may contribute to cellular dysfunction in patients with migraine and acutely injured cerebral cortex.},

To investigate the effects of the complex 3D geometry and anatomical variability of the CoW on the cerebral hemodynamics, a technique for generating physiologically accurate models of the CoW has been created using a combination of magnetic resonance data and computer-aided design software. A mathematical model of the body's cerebral autoregulation mechanism has been developed and numerous computational fluid dynamics simulations performed to model the hemodynamics in response to changes in afferent blood pressure. Three pathological conditions were explored, namely a complete CoW, a fetal P1 and a missing A1. The methodology of the cerebral hemodynamic modelling is proposed with the potential for future clinical application in mind, as a diagnostic tool.},

	Abstract = {Cortical neural activities lead to changes in the cerebral blood flow (CBF), which involves astrocytic control of cerebrovascular tone. However, the manner in which astrocytic activity specifically leads to vasodilation or vasoconstriction is difficult to determine. Here, cortical astrocytes genetically expressing a light-sensitive cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), were transcranially activated with a blue laser while the spatiotemporal changes in CBF were noninvasively monitored with laser speckle flowgraphy in the anesthetised mouse cortex. A brief photostimulation induced a fast transient increase in CBF. The average response onset time was 0.7 $\pm$ 0.7 sec at the activation foci, and this CBF increase spread widely from the irradiation spot with an apparent propagation speed of 0.8-1.1 mm/sec. The broad increase in the CBF could be due to a propagation of diffusible vasoactive signals derived from the stimulated astrocytes. Pharmacological manipulation showed that topical administration of a K(+) channel inhibitor (BaCl2; 0.1-0.5 mM) significantly reduced the photostimulation-induced CBF responses, which indicates that the ChR2-evoked astrocytic activity involves K(+) signalling to the vascular smooth muscle cells. These findings demonstrate a unique model for exploring the role of the astrocytes in gliovascular coupling using non-invasive, time-controlled, cell-type specific perturbations.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of the cardiac ventricular action potential is presented. In our previous work, the membrane Na+ current and K+ currents were formulated. The present article focuses on processes that regulate intracellular Ca2+ and depend on its concentration. The model presented here for the mammalian ventricular action potential is based mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides the framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells with appropriate modifications made to account for species differences. The following processes are formulated: Ca2+ current through the L-type channel (ICa), the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), buffering of Ca2+ in the SR and in the myoplasm, a Ca2+ pump in the sarcolemma, the Na(+)-K+ pump, and a nonspecific Ca(2+)-activated membrane current. Activation of ICa is an order of magnitude faster than in previous models. Inactivation of ICa depends on both the membrane voltage and [Ca2+]i. SR is divided into two subcompartments, a network SR (NSR) and a junctional SR (JSR). Functionally, Ca2+ enters the NSR and translocates to the JSR following a monoexponential function. Release of Ca2+ occurs at JSR and can be triggered by two different mechanisms, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and spontaneous release. The model provides the basis for the study of arrhythmogenic activity of the single myocyte including afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. It can simulate cellular responses under different degrees of Ca2+ overload. Such simulations are presented in our accompanying article in this issue of Circulation Research.},

	Abstract = {Hemodynamic regulation of the endothelial gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) was studied in a model of controlled disturbed flows in vitro. Cx43 mRNA, protein expression, and intercellular communication were mapped to spatial variations in fluid forces. Hemodynamic features of atherosclerotic lesion-prone regions of the vasculature (flow separation and recirculation) were created for periods of 5, 16, and 30 h, with laminar shear stresses ranging between 0 and 13.5 dynes/cm2. Within 5 h, endothelial Cx43 mRNA expression was increased in all cells when compared with no-flow controls, with highest levels (up to 6- to 8-fold) expressed in regions of flow recirculation corresponding to high shear stress gradients. At 16 h, Cx43 mRNA expression remained elevated in regions of flow disturbance, whereas in areas of fully developed, undisturbed laminar flow, Cx43 expression returned to control levels. In all flow regions, typical punctate Cx43 immunofluorescence at cell borders was disrupted by 5 h. After 30 h of flow, disruption of gap junctions persisted in cells subjected to flow separation and recirculation, whereas regions of undisturbed flow were substantially restored to normal. These expression differences were reflected in sustained inhibition of intercellular communication (dye transfer) throughout the zone of disturbed flow (84.2 and 68.4{\%} inhibition at 5 and 30 h, respectively); in contrast, communication was fully reestablished by 30 h in cells exposed to undisturbed flow. Up-regulation of Cx43 transcripts, sustained disorganization of Cx43 protein, and impaired communication suggest that shear stress gradients in regions of disturbed flow regulate intercellular communication through the expression and function of Cx43.},

@article{Comerford2008,
	Abstract = {It is well known that atherosclerosis occurs at very specific locations throughout the human vasculature, such as arterial bifurcations and bends, all of which are subjected to low wall shear stress. A key player in the pathology of atherosclerosis is the endothelium, controlling the passage of material to and from the artery wall. Endothelial dysfunction refers to the condition where the normal regulation of processes by the endothelium is diminished. In this paper, the blood flow and transport of the low diffusion coefficient species adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are investigated in a variety of arterial geometries: a bifurcation with varying inner angle, and an artery bend. A mathematical model of endothelial calcium and endothelial nitric oxide synthase cellular dynamics is used to investigate spatial variations in the physiology of the endothelium. This model allows assessment of regions of the artery wall deficient in nitric oxide (NO). The models here aim to determine whether 3D flow fields are important in determining ATP concentration and endothelial function. For ATP transport, the effects of a coronary and carotid wave form on mass transport is investigated for low Womersley number. For the carotid, the Womersley number is then increased to determine whether this is an important factor. The results show that regions of low wall shear stress correspond with regions of impaired endothetial nitric oxide synthase signaling, therefore reduced availability of NO. However, experimental work is required to determine if this level is significant. The results also suggest that bifurcation angle is an important factor and acute angle bifurcations are more susceptible to disease than large angle bifurcations. It has been evidenced that complex 3D flow fields play an important role in determining signaling within endothelial cells. Furthermore, the distribution of ATP in blood is highly dependent on secondary flow features. The models here use ATP concentration simulated under steady conditions. This has been evidenced to reproduce essential features of time-averaged ATP concentration over a cardiac cycle for small Womersley numbers. However, when the Womersley number is increased, some differences are observed. Transient variations are overall insignificant, suggesting that spatial variation is more important than temporal. It has been determined that acute angle bifurcations are potentially more susceptible to atherogenesis and steady-state ATP transport reproduces essential features of time-averaged pulsatile transport for small Womersley number. Larger Womersley numbers appear to be an important factor in time-dependent mass transfer.},

Initially, we categorize the cerebral circulation and then review the vascular anatomy. We draw attention to a number of unique features of the cerebral vasculature, which are relevant to the microcirculatory response during ischemia: arterial histology, species differences, collateral flow, the venous drainage, the blood-brain barrier, astrocytes and vascular nerves. The physiology of the arterial microcirculation is then assessed. Lastly, we review the changes during ischemia which impact on the microcirculation. Further understanding of the normal cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology as well as the pathophysiology of ischemia will allow the rational development of a pharmacologic therapy for human stroke and brain injury. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Fundamental questions remain unanswered about astrocyte calcium signaling, as current methods can not resolve calcium in small volume compartments, such as near the cell membrane and in distal cell processes. We modified the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP2 with a membrane-tethering domain, Lck, increasing the level of Lck-GCaMP2 near the plasma membrane tenfold as compared with conventional GCaMP2. Using Lck-GCaMP2 in rat hippocampal astrocyte-neuron cocultures, we measured near-membrane calcium signals that were evoked pharmacologically or by single action potential-mediated neurotransmitter release. Moreover, we identified highly localized and frequent spontaneous calcium signals in astrocyte somata and processes that conventional GCaMP2 failed to detect. Lck-GCaMP2 acts as a genetically targeted calcium sensor for monitoring calcium signals in previously inaccessible parts of astrocytes, including fine processes.},

	Abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) has traditionally been regarded as an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS in which clinical symptoms result from axon conduction block caused by myelin degradation. However, typical accumulation of permanent neurological deficits during the clinical course of MS cannot be explained solely by de- and remyelinating processes. It is considered to be rather due to neuronal degeneration, for which several reasons could be identified depending on the state of the disease. First, neurons and their axons can be damaged by infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages either directly by cell-to-cell contact or by the release of harmful mediators such as nitric oxide or glutamate. Second, indirect injury to neurons and axons may occur through the loss of trophic support by neighbouring oligodendrocytes due to destruction of both the myelin sheath and the oligodendrocyte itself. Third, redistribution of certain voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and transporters along naked demyelinated axons restores axonal conduction but also leads to excessive spatially restricted electrical activity of the axonal membrane, intracellular calcium accumulation, impairment of mitochondrial function, and subsequent neuronal degeneration. The neuroprotective potential of pharmacological modulation of these channels and transporters using already approved drugs has been demonstrated in several animal studies, is the subject of current clinical trials and will be the topic of this review.},

	Abstract = {The molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of the majority of cases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. A history of stroke was found to be associated with development of some AD cases, especially in the presence of vascular risk factors. Reduced cerebral perfusion is a common vascular component among AD risk factors, and hypoxia is a direct consequence of hypoperfusion. Previously we showed that expression of the beta-site beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) gene BACE1 is tightly controlled at both the transcriptional and translational levels and that increased BACE1 maturation contributes to the AD pathogenesis in Down's syndrome. Here we have identified a functional hypoxia-responsive element in the BACE1 gene promoter. Hypoxia up-regulated beta-secretase cleavage of APP and amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) production by increasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression both in vitro and in vivo. Hypoxia treatment markedly increased Abeta deposition and neuritic plaque formation and potentiated the memory deficit in Swedish mutant APP transgenic mice. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that hypoxia can facilitate AD pathogenesis, and they provide a molecular mechanism linking vascular factors to AD. Our study suggests that interventions to improve cerebral perfusion may benefit AD patients.},

As NIRS does not provide a measure of dynamic changes{\$}\backslash{\$}nin blood flow during brain activation, we relied on a Windkessel{\$}\backslash{\$}nmodel that relates dynamic blood volume and flowchanges, which has{\$}\backslash{\$}nbeen used previously for estimating CMRO2 from functional magnetic{\$}\backslash{\$}nresonance imaging (fMRI) data. Because of the partial volume effect{\$}\backslash{\$}nwe are unable to quantify the absolute changes in the local brain{\$}\backslash{\$}nhaemoglobin concentrations with NIRS and thus are unable to obtain{\$}\backslash{\$}nan estimate of the absolute CMRO2 change. An absolute estimate is{\$}\backslash{\$}nalso confounded by uncertainty in the flow-volume relationship. However,{\$}\backslash{\$}nthe ratio of the flow change to the CMRO2 change is relatively insensitive{\$}\backslash{\$}nto these uncertainties. For the finger tapping task, we estimate{\$}\backslash{\$}na most probable flow-consumption ratio ranging from 1.5 to 3 in agreement{\$}\backslash{\$}nwith previous findings presented in the literature, although we cannot{\$}\backslash{\$}nexclude the possibility that there is no CMRO2 change. The large{\$}\backslash{\$}nrange in the ratio arises from the large number of model parameters{\$}\backslash{\$}nthat must be estimated from the data. Amore precise estimate of the{\$}\backslash{\$}nflow-consumption ratio will require better estimates of the model{\$}\backslash{\$}nparameters or flow information, as can be provided by combining NIRS{\$}\backslash{\$}nwith fMRI.},

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional presynaptic calcium diffusion model developed to account for characteristics of transmitter release was modified to provide for binding of calcium to a receptor and subsequent triggering of exocytosis. When low affinity (20 microM) and rapid kinetics were assumed for the calcium receptor triggering exocytosis, and stimulus parameters were selected to match those of experiments, the simulations predicted a virtual invariance of the time course of transmitter release to paired stimulation, stimulation with pulses of different amplitude, and stimulation in different calcium solutions. The large temperature sensitivity of experimental release time course was explained by a temperature sensitivity of the model's final rate limiting exocytotic process. Inclusion of calcium tail currents and a saturable buffer with finite binding kinetics resulted in high peak calcium transients near release sites, exceeding 100 microM. Models with a single class of calcium binding site to the secretory trigger molecule failed to produce sufficient synaptic facilitation under this condition. When at least one calcium ion binds to a different site having higher affinity and slow kinetics, facilitation again reaches levels similar to those seen experimentally. It is possible that the neurosecretory trigger molecule reacts with calcium at more than one class of binding site.},

	Abstract = {The cellular mechanisms that couple activity of glutamatergic synapses with changes in blood flow, measured by a variety of techniques including the BOLD signal, have not previously been modelled. Here we provide such a model, that successfully accounts for the main observed changes in blood flow in both visual cortex and somatosensory cortex following their stimulation by high-contrast drifting grating or by single whisker stimulation, respectively. Coupling from glutamatergic synapses to smooth muscle cells of arterioles is effected by astrocytes releasing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) onto them, following glutamate stimulation of the astrocyte. Coupling of EETs to the smooth muscle of arterioles is by means of potassium channels in their membranes, leading to hyperpolarization, relaxation and hence an increase in blood flow. This model predicts a linear increase in blood flow with increasing numbers of activated astrocytes, but a non-linear increase with increasing glutamate release. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {An imbalance of intracellular calcium homeostasis induced by amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer׳s disease (AD), such as deficits in learning and memory. Therefore, regulation of calcium homeostasis may represent a new strategy for treatment of AD. Growing evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and AD are closely related in pathogenesis. Thus, drugs used in treatment of T2DM may modify the pathogenesis of AD. This study demonstrated that Exendin-4, which is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog used as a therapeutic drug for T2DM, significantly antagonized suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by A$\beta$1-42 in the rat hippocampal CA1 region in vivo. This neuroprotection may be mediated by regulation of calcium homeostasis. Pretreatment with Exendin-4 suppressed A$\beta$1-42-induced elevation in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) through L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCCs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Furthermore, Exendin-4 antagonized the decrease in p-Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II$\alpha$ (p-CaMKII$\alpha$) induced by A$\beta$1-42 in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. Thus, the neuroprotective effects of Exendin-4, which likely involve regulation of calcium homeostasis, provide theoretical support for using Exendin-4 to treat and prevent AD in the future.},

@article{Buxton2002,
	Abstract = {The central idea of the oxygen limitation model is that the oxygen extraction fraction E must decrease during neuronal activation, so a large change in cerebral blood flow (CBF) is required to support a small change in the cerebral metabolic rate of O2 (CMRO2). The model is expanded here to show that maintaining mitochondrial pO2 at a constant non-zero level during activation, so that O2 availability does not become limiting for CMRO2, still requires the fractional CBF change to be several times larger than the CMRO2 change. Furthermore, the expanded model also allows for a brief initial increase in E at stimulus onset with a corresponding transient dip in cytoplasm and mitochondrial pO2. However, because the tissue pO2 must increase to support a higher CMRO2, the tissue O2 content itself would be an ambiguous signal for regulating CBF. For this reason, although the function served by a large CBF increase may be to support CMRO2, the tissue O2 content itself is probably not the key factor for regulation of CBF.},

	Abstract = {Advances in fluorescent calcium indicating dyes over the past decade have identified calcium signaling as the tool by which astrocytes communicate among themselves and with neighboring neurons. Studies of astrocyte-neuron interactions have shown that calcium signaling is a potent modulator of the strength of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The concept that astrocytes possess a mechanism for rapid cell communication has not been incorporated, however, into the supportive functions of astrocytes. Because many of the classical tasks of astrocytes are linked to the blood-brain barrier, we have here examined the expression of proteins required for calcium signaling in their vascular end-foot processes. The gap junction protein, Cx43, was expressed intensively around the vessels interconnecting astrocytic end-foot processes. These gap junctions permitted diffusion of Lucifer yellow, specifically along the path of glial end feet apposed to the vessel wall. The purinergic receptors, P2Y(2) and P2Y(4), were also strongly expressed at the gliovascular interface and colocalized with GFAP around larger vessels in cortex. Multiphoton imaging of freshly prepared brain slices loaded with Fluo-4/AM revealed that ATP mobilized cytosolic calcium in astrocytic end feet, whereas electrical stimulation triggered calcium waves propagating along the vessel wall. Brain endothelial cells and pericytes were physically separated from astrocytes by the basal lamina and responded only weakly to ATP. These observations identify astrocytic end-foot processes plastered at the vessel wall as a center for purinergic signaling. It is speculated that calcium signaling may play a role in astrocytic functions related to the blood-brain barrier, including blood flow regulation, metabolic trafficking, and water homeostasis.},

@article{Higashimori2010,
	Abstract = {Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), synthesized and released by astrocytes in response to glutamate, are known to play a pivotal role in neurovascular coupling. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), EETs activate large-conductance, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels resulting in hyperpolarization and vasodilation. However, the functional role and mechanism of action for glial-derived EETs are still to be determined. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the synthetic EET analog 11-nonyloxy-undec-8(Z)-enoic acid (NUD-GA) on outward K(+) currents mediated by calcium-activated K(+) channels. Addition of NUD-GA significantly increased intracellular Ca(2+) and outward K(+) currents in perivascular astrocytes. NUD-GA-induced currents were significantly inhibited by BK channel blockers paxilline and tetraethylammonium (TEA) (23.4 $\pm$ 2.4{\%}; P {\textless} 0.0005). Similarly, NUD-GA-induced currents were also significantly inhibited in the presence of the small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel inhibitor apamin along with a combination of blockers against glutamate receptors (12.8 $\pm$ 2.70{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05). No changes in outward currents were observed in the presence of the channel blocker for intermediate-conductance K(+) channels TRAM-34. Blockade of the endogenous production of EETs with N-methylsulfonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH) significantly blunted (dl)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD)-induced outward K(+) currents (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 6). Both NUD-GA and t-ACPD significantly increased BK channel single open probability; the later was blocked following MS-PPOH incubation. Our data supports the idea that EETs are potent K(+) channel modulators in cortical perivascular astrocytes and further suggest that these metabolites may participate in NVC by modulating the levels of K(+) released at the gliovascular space.},

@article{Hunter2005,
	Abstract = {Regulation of gap junction (GJ) organization is critical for proper function of excitable tissues such as heart and brain, yet mechanisms that govern the dynamic patterning of GJs remain poorly defined. Here, we show that zonula occludens (ZO)-1 localizes preferentially to the periphery of connexin43 (Cx43) GJ plaques. Blockade of the PDS95/dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-mediated interaction between ZO-1 and Cx43, by genetic tagging of Cx43 or by a membrane-permeable peptide inhibitor that contains the Cx43 PDZ-binding domain, led to a reduction of peripherally associated ZO-1 accompanied by a significant increase in plaque size. Biochemical data indicate that the size increase was due to unregulated accumulation of gap junctional channels from nonjunctional pools, rather than to increased protein expression or decreased turnover. Coexpression of native Cx43 fully rescued the aberrant tagged-connexin phenotype, but only if channels were composed predominately of untagged connexin. Confocal image analysis revealed that, subsequent to GJ nucleation, ZO-1 association with Cx43 GJs is independent of plaque size. We propose that ZO-1 controls the rate of Cx43 channel accretion at GJ peripheries, which, in conjunction with the rate of GJ turnover, regulates GJ size and distribution.},

@article{Kapela2008,
	Abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in [Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

	Abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) evokes a large cerebral blood flow (CBF) increase in normal rat brain. In contrast, in focal ischemic penumbra, CSD-like periinfarct depolarizations (PID) are mainly associated with hypoperfusion. Because PIDs electrophysiologically closely resemble CSD, we tested whether conditions present in ischemic penumbra, such as tissue hypoxia or reduced perfusion pressure, transform the CSD-induced CBF response in nonischemic rat cortex. Cerebral blood flow changes were recorded using laser Doppler flowmetry in rats subjected to hypoxia, hypotension, or both. Under normoxic normotensive conditions, CSD caused a characteristic transient CBF increase (74+/-7{\%}) occasionally preceded by a small hypoperfusion (-4+/-2{\%}). Both hypoxia (pO(2) 45+/-3 mm Hg) and hypotension (blood pressure 42+/-2 mm Hg) independently augmented this initial hypoperfusion (-14+/-2{\%} normoxic hypotension; -16+/-6{\%} hypoxic normotension; -21+/-5{\%} hypoxic hypotension) and diminished the magnitude of hyperemia (44+/-10{\%} normoxic hypotension; 43+/-9{\%} hypoxic normotension; 27+/-6{\%} hypoxic hypotension). Hypotension and, to a much lesser extent, hypoxia increased the duration of hypoperfusion and the DC shift, whereas CSD amplitude remained unchanged. These results suggest that hypoxia and/or hypotension unmask a vasoconstrictive response during CSD in the rat such that, under nonphysiologic conditions (i.e., mimicking ischemic penumbra), the hyperemic response to CSD becomes attenuated resembling the blood flow response during PIDs.},

	Abstract = {Following stimulation of NMDA receptors, neurons transiently synthesize nitric oxide (NO) in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner through the activation of neuronal NO synthase. Nitric oxide acts as a messenger, activating soluble guanylyl cyclase and participating in the transduction signalling pathways involving cyclic GMP. Nitric oxide also binds to cytochrome c oxidase, and is able to inhibit cell respiration in a process that is reversible and in competition with oxygen. This action can also lead to the release of superoxide anion from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Here, we discuss recent evidence that this mitochondrial interaction represents a molecular switch for cell signalling pathways involved in the control of physiological functions. These include superoxide- or oxygen-dependent modulation of gene transcription, calcium-dependent cell signalling responses, changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential or AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent control of glycolysis. In pathophysiological conditions, such as brain ischaemia or neurological disorders, NO is formed excessively by NMDA receptor over-activation in neurons, or by inducible NO synthase from neighbouring glia (microglial cells and astrocytes). Elevated NO concentrations can then interact with superoxide anion, generated by the mitochondria or by other mechanisms, leading to the formation of the powerful oxidant species peroxynitrite. During pathological conditions activation of the NAD(+)-consuming enzyme poly(APD-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is also a likely mechanism for NO-mediated energy failure and neurotoxicity. Activation of PARP-1 is, however, a repair process, which in milder forms of oxidative stress protects neurons from death. Thus, whilst NO plays a physiological role in neuronal cell signalling, its over-production may cause neuronal energy compromise leading to neurodegeneration.},

	Abstract = {Vascular cells communicate electrically to coordinate their activity and control tissue blood flow. To foster a quantitative understanding of this fundamental process, we developed a computational model that was structured to mimic a skeletal muscle resistance artery. Each endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell in our virtual artery was treated as the electrical equivalent of a capacitor coupled in parallel with a non-linear resistor representing ionic conductance; intercellular gap junctions were represented by ohmic resistors. Simulations revealed that the vessel wall is not a syncytium in which electrical stimuli spread equally to all constitutive cells. Indeed, electrical signals spread in a differential manner among and between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells according to the initial stimulus. The predictions of our model agree with physiological data from the feed artery of the hamster retractor muscle. Cell orientation and coupling resistance were the principal factors that enable electrical signals to spread differentially along and between the two cell types. Our computational observations also illustrated how gap junctional coupling enables the vessel wall to filter and transform transient electrical events into sustained voltage responses. Functionally, differential electrical communication would permit discrete regions of smooth muscle activity to locally regulate blood flow and the endothelium to coordinate regional changes in tissue perfusion.},

	Abstract = {Population signals from neuronal ensembles in cortex during behavior are commonly measured with EEG, local field potential (LFP), and voltage-sensitive dyes. A genetically encoded voltage indicator would be useful for detection of such signals in specific cell types. Here we describe how this goal can be achieved with Butterfly, a voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein (VSFP) with a subthreshold detection range and enhancements designed for voltage imaging from single neurons to brain in vivo. VSFP-Butterfly showed reliable membrane targeting, maximum response gain around standard neuronal resting membrane potential, fast kinetics for single-cell synaptic responses, and a high signal-to-noise ratio. Butterfly reports excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in cortical neurons, whisker-evoked responses in barrel cortex, 25-Hz gamma oscillations in hippocampal slices, and 2- to 12-Hz slow waves during brain state modulation in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that cell class-specific voltage imaging is practical with VSFP-Butterfly, and expand the genetic toolbox for the detection of neuronal population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {One hundred and twenty five years ago, Roy and Sherrington made the seminal observation that neuronal stimulation evokes an increase in cerebral blood flow.1 Since this discovery, researchers have attempted to uncover how the cells of the neurovascular unit---neurons, astrocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells and pericytes---coordinate their activity to control this phenomenon. Recent work has revealed that ionic fluxes through a diverse array of ion channel species allow the cells of the neurovascular unit to engage in multicellular signaling processes that dictate local hemodynamics. In this review we center our discussion on two major themes: (1) the roles of ion channels in the dynamic modulation of parenchymal arteriole smooth muscle membrane potential, which is central to the control of arteriolar diameter and therefore must be harnessed to permit changes in downstream cerebral blood flow, and (2) the striking similarities in the ion channel complements employed in astrocytic endfeet and endothelial cells, enabling dual control of smooth muscle from either side of the blood--brain barrier.We conclude with a discussion of the emerging roles of pericyte and capillary endothelial cell ion channels in neurovascular coupling, which will provide fertile ground for future breakthroughs in the field.},

	Abstract = {In this paper a one-dimensional model of a vascular network based on space-time variables is investigated. Although the one-dimensional system has been more widely studied using a space-frequency decomposition, the space-time formulation offers a more direct physical interpretation of the dynamics of the system. The objective of the paper is to highlight how the space-time representation of the linear and nonlinear one-dimensional system can be theoretically and numerically modelled. In deriving the governing equations from first principles, the assumptions involved in constructing the system in terms of area-mass flux (A,Q), area-velocity (A,u), pressure-velocity (p,u) and pressure-mass flux(p,Q) variables are discussed. For the nonlinear hyperbolic system expressed in terms of the (A,u) variables the extension of the single-vessel model to a network of vessels is achieved using a characteristic decomposition combined with conservation of mass and total pressure. The more widely studied linearised system is also discussed where conservation of static pressure, instead of total pressure, is enforced in the extension to a network. Consideration of the linearised system also allows for the derivation of a reflection coefficient analogous to the approach adopted in acoustics and surface waves. The derivation of the fundamental equations in conservative and characteristic variables provides the basic information for many numerical approaches. In the current work the linear and nonlinear systems have been solved using a spectral/hp element spatial discretisation with a discontinuous Galerkin formulation and a second-order Adams-Bashforth time-integration scheme. The numerical scheme is then applied to a model arterial network of the human vascular system previously studied by Wang and Parker (To appear in J. Biomech. (2004)). Using this numerical model the role of nonlinearity is also considered by comparison of the linearised and nonlinearised results. Similar to previous work only secondary contributions are observed from the nonlinear effects under physiological conditions in the systemic system. Finally, the effect of the reflection coefficient on reversal of the flow waveform in the parent vessel of a bifurcation is considered for a system with a low terminal resistance as observed in vessels such as the umbilical arteries.},

	Abstract = {To detect nitric oxide (NO) in the rat brain during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was employed with the NO trapping technique, using an iron and N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) complex. An X-band (about 9.5 GHz) EPR system detected a triplet signal (g = 2.038) derived from an NO-Fe-DETC complex being superimposed on the g(perpendicular) signal of Cu-DETC complex at liquid nitrogen temperature. The height of the triplet signal peaked seven hours after injection of 40 mg/kg of LPS, and over 25 x 10(4) U/kg of IFN-gamma enhanced the LPS-induced NO formation. Pretreatment with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an NO synthase inhibitor, deleted only the triplet signal. A triplet signal (g(iso) = 2.040, aN = 1.28 mT) derived from the NO-Fe-DETC complex was also observed at ambient temperature. Then, a home-built 700 MHz EPR system was used to detect an NO signal in the septic rat brain in vivo. We successfully monitored the NO-Fe-DETC signal in the head region of a living rat under the condition that provided maximum height of the NO-Fe-DETC signal in the X-band EPR study. Pretreatment with NMMA again deleted the NO-Fe-DETC signal. This is the first EPR observation of endogenous NO in the brain of living rats.},

	Abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (SD) has been suggested to underlie migraine aura. Despite a precise match in speed, the spatio-temporal patterns of SD observed in animal cortex and aura symptoms mapped to the cortical surface ordinarily differ in aspects of size and shape. We show that this mismatch is reconciled by utilizing that both pattern types bifurcate from an instability point of generic reaction-diffusion models. To classify these spatio-temporal pattern we suggest a susceptibility scale having the value sigma = 1 at the instability point. We predict that human cortex is only weakly susceptible to SD (sigma{\textless}1), and support this prediction by directly matching visual aura symptoms with anatomical landmarks using fMRI retinotopic mapping. Moreover, we use retinal SD to give a proof of concept of the existence of this instability point and describe how cortical susceptibility to SD must be adjusted for migraine drug testing. Close to the instability point at sigma = 1 the dynamical repertoire of cortical tissue is increased. As a consequence, the picture of an engulfing SD that became paradigmatic for migraine with aura needs to be modified in most cases towards a more spatially confined pattern that remains within the originating major gyrus or sulcus. Furthermore, we discuss the resulting implications on migraine pharmacology that is hitherto tested in the regime (sigma{\textgreater}1), and potentially silent aura occurring below a second bifurcation point at sigma = 0 on the susceptible scale.},

@article{Varon1979,
	Abstract = {The progress of research in the Central Nervous System (CNS) had led to the consideration of neurons and glia as indissociable functional complexes. Neuron-glia interactions are essential for the maturation of the CNS. Glial cells release trophic factors for neurons (NGF) and neurons release trophic factors for glia (GGF). Furthermore, the latter provide a substrate for the migration of neurons and guidance of axons by mean of adhesion molecules. In adults, the interactions between neurons and glial cells serve to maintain homeostasis. Thus, the glial cells perform the restoration of the metabolic equilibrium overthrown by the transmission of the nerve impulse and provide the glucose required for neuronal activity. The nerve impulse provokes increases in the cellular space of CO2, K+, NH3 and neurotransmitters which must be taken up to allow neuronal activity to continue (in normal conditions). Astrocytes perform the uptake of the extracellular K+ by means of passive ionic channels, ionic voltage-dependent channels and a sodium-potassium-ATPase-dependent pump. The oligodendrocytes are involved in the metabolism of CO2 by converting CO2 into carbonic acid by means of carbonic anhydrase. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes play a role in terminating neural transmission by the uptake of the amino acid neurotransmitters, such as GABA, glutamate and aspartate. The catabolism of glutamate to glutamine by means of glutamine synthetase allows both the conversion of an excitatory amino acid into a neutral amino acid (which can diffuse in the extracellular space without causing neural transmission) and the reduction of cerebral NH3 content.},

	Abstract = {Dendritic morphology constrains brain activity, as it determines first which neuronal circuits are possible and second which dendritic computations can be performed over a neuron's inputs. It is known that a range of chemical cues can influence the final shape of dendrites during development. Here, we investigate the extent to which self-referential influences, cues generated by the neuron itself, might influence morphology. To this end, we developed a phenomenological model and algorithm to generate virtual morphologies, which are then compared to experimentally reconstructed morphologies. In the model, branching probability follows a Galton-Watson process, while the geometry is determined by "homotypic forces" exerting influence on the direction of random growth in a constrained space. We model three such homotypic forces, namely an inertial force based on membrane stiffness, a soma-oriented tropism, and a force of self-avoidance, as directional biases in the growth algorithm. With computer simulations we explored how each bias shapes neuronal morphologies. We show that based on these principles, we can generate realistic morphologies of several distinct neuronal types. We discuss the extent to which homotypic forces might influence real dendritic morphologies, and speculate about the influence of other environmental cues on neuronal shape and circuitry.},

	Abstract = {Calcium cycling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the cytosol via the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) pump, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R), and Ryanodine receptor (RyR), plays a major role in agonist-induced intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Levels of these calcium handling proteins in SR get altered under disease conditions. We have developed a mathematical model to understand the significance of altered levels of SERCA, IP3R, and RyR on the intracellular calcium dynamics of VSMC and to understand how variation in protein levels that arise due to diabetes contribute to different VSMC behavior and thus vascular disease. SR is modeled as a single continuous entity with homogeneous intra-SR calcium. Model results show that agonist-induced intracellular calcium dynamics can be modified by changing the levels of SERCA, IP3R, and/or RyR. Lowering SERCA level will enable intracellular calcium oscillations at low agonist concentrations whereas lowered levels of IP3R and RyR need higher agonist concentration for intracellular calcium oscillations. This research suggests that reduced SERCA level is the main factor responsible for the reduced intracellular calcium transients and contractility in VSMCs.},

	Abstract = {The penumbra is an area of brain tissue that is damaged but not yet dead after focal ischemia. The existence of a penumbra implies that therapeutic salvage is theoretically possible after stroke. The first decade of penumbral science investigated the ischemic regulation of electrophysiology, cerebral blood flow and metabolism. The second decade advanced our understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate penumbral cell death. And the third decade saw the rapid development of clinical neuroimaging tools that are now increasingly applied in stroke patients. But how can we look ahead as we move into the fourth decade of penumbra research? This author speculates that a paradigm shift is needed. Most molecular targets for therapy have biphasic roles in stroke pathophysiology. During the acute phase, these targets mediate injury. During the recovery phase, the same mediators contribute to neurovascular remodeling. It is this boundary zone that comprises the new penumbra, and future investigations should dissect where, when and how damaged brain makes the transition from injury into repair.},

@article{McMurry2011,
	Abstract = {Using interferometry-based biosensors the binding and release of endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) from calmodulin (CaM) was measured. In both isoforms, binding to CaM is diffusion limited and within approximately three orders of magnitude of the Smoluchowski limit imposed by orientation-independent collisions. This suggests that the orientation of CaM is facilitated by the charge arrays on the CaM-binding site and the complementary surface on CaM. Protein kinase C phosphorylation of eNOS T495, adjacent to the CaM-binding site, abolishes or greatly slows CaM binding. Kinases which increase the activity of eNOS did not stimulate the binding of CaM, which is already diffusion limited. The coupling of Ca(2+) binding and CaM/NOS binding equilibria links the affinity of CaM for NOS to the Ca(2+) dependence of CaM binding. Hence, changes in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of CaM binding always imply changes in the NOS-CaM affinity. It is possible, however, that in some regimes binding and activation are not synonymous, so that Ca(2+) sensitivity need not be tightly linked to CaM sensitivity of activation. This study is being extended using mutants to probe the roles of individual structural elements in binding and release.},

	Abstract = {The present study sought to determine the downstream consequences of V1a vasopressin receptor (V1aR) activation of Ca2+ signaling in cortical astrocytes. Results of these analyses demonstrated that V1aR activation led to a marked increase in both cytoplasmic and nuclear Ca2+. We also investigated V1aR activation of Ca2+-activated signaling kinases, protein kinase C (PKC), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases [MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)], their localization within cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, and activation of their downstream nuclear target, the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Results of these analyses demonstrated that V1aR activation led to a significant rise in PKC, CaMKII, and ERK1/2 activation, with CaMKII and ERK1/2 demonstrating dynamic transport between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Although no evidence of PKC translocation was apparent, PKC and CaMKs were required for activation and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2. Subsequent to CaMKII and ERK1/2 translocation to the nucleus, CREB activation occurred and was found to be dependent on upstream activation of ERK1/2 and CaMKs. These data provide the first systematic analysis of the V1aR-induced Ca2+ signaling cascade in cortical astrocytes. In addition, results of this study introduce a heretofore unknown effect of vasopressin, dynamic Ca2+ signaling between the cytoplasm and nucleus that leads to comparable dynamics of kinase activation and shuttling between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Implications for development and regeneration induced by V1aR activation of CREB-regulated gene expression in cortical astrocytes are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Aerobic glycolysis is defined as glucose utilization in excess of that used for oxidative phosphorylation despite sufficient oxygen to completely metabolize glucose to carbon dioxide and water. Aerobic glycolysis is present in the normal human brain at rest and increases locally during increased neuronal activity; yet its many biological functions have received scant attention because of a prevailing energy-centric focus on the role of glucose as substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. As an initial step in redressing this neglect, we measured the regional distribution of aerobic glycolysis with positron emission tomography in 33 neurologically normal young adults at rest. We show that the distribution of aerobic glycolysis in the brain is differentially present in previously well-described functional areas. In particular, aerobic glycolysis is significantly elevated in medial and lateral parietal and prefrontal cortices. In contrast, the cerebellum and medial temporal lobes have levels of aerobic glycolysis significantly below the brain mean. The levels of aerobic glycolysis are not strictly related to the levels of brain energy metabolism. For example, sensory cortices exhibit high metabolic rates for glucose and oxygen consumption but low rates of aerobic glycolysis. These striking regional variations in aerobic glycolysis in the normal human brain provide an opportunity to explore how brain systems differentially use the diverse cell biology of glucose in support of their functional specializations in health and disease.},

	Abstract = {Synaptic short-term plasticity is a key regulator of neuronal communication and is controlled via various mechanisms. A well established property of mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell synapses is the extensive short-term facilitation during high-frequency bursts. We investigated the mechanisms governing facilitation using a combination of whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, electrical minimal stimulation, and random-access two-photon microscopy in acute mouse hippocampal slices. Two distinct presynaptic mechanisms were involved in short-term facilitation, with their relative contribution dependent on extracellular calcium concentration. The synchronization of multivesicular release was observed during trains of facilitating EPSCs recorded in 1.2 mm external Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]e). Indeed, covariance analysis revealed a gradual augmentation in quantal size during trains of EPSCs, and application of the low-affinity glutamate receptor antagonist {\$}\gamma{\$}-d-glutamylglycine showed an increase in cleft glutamate concentration during paired-pulse stimulation. Whereas synchronization of multivesicular release contributed to the facilitation in 1.2 mm [Ca(2+)]e, variance-mean analysis showed that recruitment of more release sites (N) was likely to account for the larger facilitation observed in 2.5 mm [Ca(2+)]e. Furthermore, this increase in N could be promoted by calcium microdomains of heterogeneous amplitudes observed in single mossy fiber boutons. Our findings suggest that the combination of multivesicular release and the recruitment of additional release sites act together to increase glutamate release during burst activity. This is supported by the compartmentalized spatial profile of calcium elevations in boutons and helps to expand the dynamic range of mossy fibers information transfer.},

	Abstract = {The cellular mechanisms underlying functional hyperemia--the coupling of neuronal activation to cerebral blood vessel responses--are not yet known. Here we show in rat cortical slices that the dilation of arterioles triggered by neuronal activity is dependent on glutamate-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in astrocytes. Inhibition of these Ca(2+) responses resulted in the impairment of activity-dependent vasodilation, whereas selective activation--by patch pipette--of single astrocytes that were in contact with arterioles triggered vessel relaxation. We also found that a cyclooxygenase product is centrally involved in this astrocyte-mediated control of arterioles. In vivo blockade of glutamate-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) elevations in astrocytes reduced the blood flow increase in the somatosensory cortex during contralateral forepaw stimulation. Taken together, our findings show that neuron-to-astrocyte signaling is a key mechanism in functional hyperemia.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine how memory-encoding tasks elicit functional perfusion change in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).

METHODS: Twelve subjects with aMCI and 14 age-matched cognitively normal (CN) subjects were recruited for this study. Arterial spin-labeling perfusion MRI (ASL-MRI) was employed to measure regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) during both control and encoding task conditions.

RESULTS: Experimental results demonstrated that hypoperfusion occurred in the right precuneus and cuneus in the aMCI group, and not the CN group, during the control state. During the memory-task performance, the difference in these regional hypoperfusion areas extended to the posterior cingulate. These regional perfusion rates correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test scores. In addition, a CBF percentage increase (22.7{\%}) occurred in the right parahippocampus region during the memory-encoding task performance in the CN group, with approximately no change in the aMCI group.

CONCLUSION: Subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment had significant regional cerebral hypoperfusion and lacked the dynamic capability to modulate their regional cerebral blood flow responses to the challenge of the functional tasks.},

	Abstract = {Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to modulate the function of nitric oxide synthase (NOS); however, the precise dose-dependent effects of specific RNS and ROS on NOS function are unknown. Questions remain unanswered regarding whether pathophysiological levels of RNS and ROS alter NOS function, and if this alteration is reversible. We measured the effects of peroxynitrite (ONOO-), superoxide (O2{\textperiodcentered} -), hydroxyl radical (.OH), and H2O2 on nNOS activity. The results showed that NO production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by all four oxidants, but only O2{\textperiodcentered} - and ONOO- were inhibitory at pathophysiological concentrations (≤50 $\mu$M). Subsequent addition of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) fully restored activity after O2{\textperiodcentered} - exposure, while BH4 partially rescued the activity decrease induced by the other three oxidants. Furthermore, treatment with either ONOO- or O2{\textperiodcentered} - stimulated nNOS uncoupling with decreased NO and enhanced O2{\textperiodcentered} - generation. Thus, nNOS is reversibly uncoupled by O2{\textperiodcentered} - (≤50 $\mu$M), but irreversibly uncoupled and inactivated by ONOO-. Additionally, we observed that the mechanism by which oxidative stress alters nNOS activity involves not only BH4 oxidation, but also nNOS monomerization as well as possible degradation of the heme. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: The importance of the endothelium in the local regulation of blood flow is reflected by its influence on vascular tone by means of vasodilatory responses to many physiological stimuli. Regulatory pathways are affected by mass transport and wall shear stress (WSS), via mechanotransduction mechanisms. In the present work, we review the most relevant computational models that have been proposed to date, and introduce a general framework for modelling the responses of the endothelium to alteration in the flow, with a view to understanding the biomechanical processes involved in the pathways to endothelial dysfunction. Simulations are performed on two different patient-specific stenosed carotid artery geometries to investigate the influence of WSS and mass transport phenomena upon the agonist coupling response at the endothelium. In particular, results presented for two different models of WSS-dependent adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) release reveal that existing paradigms may not account for the conditions encountered in vivo and may therefore not be adequate to model the kinetics of ATP at the endothelium. {\textcopyright}2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The term spreading depolarization describes a wave in the gray matter of the central nervous system characterized by swelling of neurons, distortion of dendritic spines, a large change of the slow electrical potential and silencing of brain electrical activity (spreading depression). In the clinic, unequivocal electrophysiological evidence now exists that spreading depolarizations occur abundantly in individuals with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage, delayed ischemic stroke after subarachnoid hemorrhage, malignant hemispheric stroke, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury. Spreading depolarization is induced experimentally by various noxious conditions including chemicals such as potassium, glutamate, inhibitors of the sodium pump, status epilepticus, hypoxia, hypoglycemia and ischemia, but it can can also invade healthy, naive tissue. Resistance vessels respond to it with tone alterations, causing either transient hyperperfusion (physiological hemodynamic response) in healthy tissue or severe hypoperfusion (inverse hemodynamic response, or spreading ischemia) in tissue at risk for progressive damage, which contributes to lesion progression. Therapies that target spreading depolarization or the inverse hemodynamic response may potentially treat these neurological conditions.},

	Abstract = {The unravelling of the polarized distribution of AQP4 in perivascular astrocytic endfeet has revitalized the interest in the role of astrocytes in controlling water and ion exchange at the brain-blood interface. The importance of the endfeet is based on the premise that they constitute a complete coverage of the vessel wall. Despite a number of studies based on different microscopic techniques this question has yet to be resolved. We have made an electron microscopic 3D reconstruction of perivascular endfeet in CA1 (stratum moleculare) of rat hippocampus. The endfeet interdigitate and overlap, leaving no slits between them. Only in a few sites do processes--tentatively classified as processes of microglia--extend through the perivascular glial sheath to establish direct contact with the endothelial basal lamina. In contrast to the endfoot covering of the endothelial tube, the endfoot covering of the pericyte is incomplete, allowing neuropil elements to touch the basal lamina that enwraps this type of cell. The 3D reconstruction also revealed large bundles of mitochondria in the endfoot processes that came in close apposition to the perivascular endfoot membrane. Our data support the idea that in pathophysiological conditions, the perivascular astrocytic covering may control the exchange of water and solutes between blood and brain and that free diffusion is limited to narrow clefts between overlapping endfeet.},

	Abstract = {The interpretation of the blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) post-stimulus undershoot has been a topic of considerable interest, as the mechanisms behind this prominent BOLD transient may provide valuable clues on the neurovascular response process and energy supply routes of the brain. Biomechanical theories explain the origin of the BOLD undershoot through the passive ballooning of post-capillary vessels which leads to an increase in venous blood volume (CBVv, comprising deoxygenated blood in capillary, venular and arteriolar compartments), resulting in susceptibility-induced signal decrease. While there has been substantial evidence supporting a role for venous ballooning, there have also been reports arguing for a prolonged post-stimulus elevation in cerebral oxygenation consumption (CMRo2) as the primary cause. Furthermore, a contribution of post-stimulus cerebral blood flow (CBF) undershoots has also been demonstrated. To clarify the role of the venous compartment in causing the BOLD undershoot, we performed in vivo fMRI measurements of the transient ??CBVv, ??CBF and ??BOLD responses in healthy humans. We observed a slow post-stimulus return to baseline in venous CBV which supports the existence of a passive "balloon" effect, implying that previous observations of a quicker recovery of the total CBV response may be dominated by arterial CBV change. Our findings also support a significant contribution from the CBF undershoots, which, combined with a slow venous CBV response, would account for much of the BOLD undershoot. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Cells have intrinsic signalling mechanisms that are capable of sensing various deleterious conditions, both normal and pathological, and respond by mounting a variety of stress responses. Examples of normal signals are the cytokines that induce inflammatory responses in cells. Pathological signals include UV and X-ray irradiation, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), abrupt anoxia and physicochemical injury through heat or noxious chemicals. A process of wound healing can function to repair the damage caused by such injuries. In many cases, especially if the stress signal is not too severe, the cell can survive and can even become tolerant to further insults. If cells are growing, such sub-lethal insults can either cause the cell to stop growing temporarily to allow adequate time to repair the damage, or the process of cell proliferation can be stopped more permanently and the cell will enter a state of senescence . Another example of an evolutionarily conserved survival mechanism is autophagy , which enables cells to cope with periods of starvation. If such stresses become too severe, however, the cell dies, either through a process of necrosis, which is rapid and catastrophic, or through a slower and more controlled process that is carried out by a highly regulated process of programmed cell death known as apoptosis .},

Using two-photon microscopic NADH imaging and oxygen sensor microelectrodes in live mouse cortex, we find that CSD is linked to severe hypoxia and marked neuronal swelling that can last up to several minutes. Changes in dendritic structures and loss of spines during CSD are comparable to those during anoxic depolarization. Increasing O2 availability shortens the duration of CSD and improves local redox state. Our results indicate that tissue hypoxia associated with CSD is caused by a transient increase in O2 demand exceeding vascular O2 supply.},

	Abstract = {1. Vasomotion is the oscillation of vascular tone with frequencies in the range from 1 to 20 min(-1) seen in most vascular beds. The oscillation originates in the vessel wall and is seen both in vivo and in vitro. 2. Recently, our ideas on the cellular mechanisms responsible for vasomotion have improved. Three different types of cellular oscillations have been suggested. One model has suggested that oscillatory release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is important (the oscillation is based on a cytosolic oscillator). A second proposed mechanism is an oscillation originating in the sarcolemma (a membrane oscillator). A third mechanism is based on an oscillation of glycolysis (metabolic oscillator). For the two latter mechanisms, only limited experimental evidence is available. 3. To understand vasomotion, it is important to understand how the cells synchronize. For the cytosolic oscillators synchronization may occur via activation of Ca2+-sensitive ion channels by oscillatory Ca2+ release. The ensuing membrane potential oscillation feeds back on the intracellular Ca2+ stores and causes synchronization of the Ca2+ release. While membrane oscillators in adjacent smooth muscle cells could be synchronized through the same mechanism that sets up the oscillation in the individual cells, a mechanism to synchronize the metabolic-based oscillators has not been suggested. 4. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by theoretical modelling of smooth muscle cells behaviour, and the new insight into the mechanisms of vasomotion has the potential to provide tools to investigate the physiological role of vasomotion.},

	Abstract = {The linearity of the cerebral perfusion response relative to stimulus duration is an important consideration in the characterization of the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolism, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. It is also a critical component in the design and analysis of functional neuroimaging studies. To study the linearity of the CBF response to different duration stimuli, the perfusion response in primary motor and visual cortices was measured during stimulation using an arterial spin labeling technique with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows simultaneous measurement of CBF and BOLD changes. In each study, the perfusion response was measured for stimuli lasting 2, 6, and 18 sec. The CBF response was found in general to be nonlinearly related to stimulus duration, although the strength of nonlinearity varied between the motor and visual cortices. In contrast, the BOLD response was found to be strongly nonlinear in both regions studied, in agreement with previous findings. The observed nonlinearities are consistent with a model with a nonlinear step from stimulus to neural activity, a linear step from neural activity to CBF change, and a nonlinear step from CBF change to BOLD signal change.},

	Abstract = {The permeability transition pore (PTP) and the ATP-dependent potassium (mtK-ATP) channel of mitochondria are known to play key roles in mitochondrially mediated apoptosis. We investigated how modulation of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and the ATP-dependent potassium (mtK-ATP) channel, either as single elements or in combination, affects the proapoptotic intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients and the mitochondrial membrane potential (psi(m)). For this purpose a model was established exploring the [Ca(2+)](i) transients in N2A cells using continuous application of ATP that causes a biphasic [Ca(2+)](i) response. This response was sensitive to endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) depletion and a smooth ER Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) antagonist. PTP inhibition by cyclosporine A (CsA) or its non-immunosuppressive derivative NIM811 caused an amplification of the secondary [Ca(2+)](i) peak and induced a hyperpolarization of psi(m). Both the putative mtK-ATP channel inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) and the opener diazoxide ameliorated the ATP-induced secondary [Ca(2+)](i) peak. The effect of diazoxide was accompanied by a depolarization of psi(m) whereas 5-HD had no effect on psi(m). When diazoxide and CsA or NIM811 were applied together the secondary [Ca(2+)](i) rise did not return to baseline and a not significant hyperpolarization of psi(m) was observed. So, simultaneous inhibition of PTP and activation of the mtK-ATP channel prevents the increased slope of the secondary [Ca(2+)](i) peak induced by CsA (or NIM811) and also the depolarization after diazoxide application. Hence, we propose that modulation of one of these channels leads to functional changes of the other channel by means of Delta[Ca(2+)](i) and Deltapsi(m).},

	Abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

	Abstract = {Stroke and circulatory arrest cause interferences in blood flow to the brain that result in considerable tissue damage. The primary method to reduce or prevent neurologic damage to patients suffering from brain ischemia is prompt restoration of blood flow to the ischemic tissue. However, paradoxically, restoration of blood flow causes additional damage and exacerbates neurocognitive deficits among patients who suffer a brain ischemic event. Mitochondria play a critical role in reperfusion injury by producing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) thereby damaging cellular components, and initiating cell death. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial ROS generation during reperfusion, and specifically, the role the mitochondrial membrane potential plays in the pathology of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, we propose a temporal model of ROS generation in which posttranslational modifications of key oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) proteins caused by ischemia induce a hyperactive state upon reintroduction of oxygen. Hyperactive OxPhos generates high mitochondrial membrane potentials, a condition known to generate excessive ROS. Such a state would lead to a "burst" of ROS upon reperfusion, thereby causing structural and functional damage to the mitochondria and inducing cell death signaling that eventually culminate in tissue damage. Finally, we propose that strategies aimed at modulating this maladaptive hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential may be a novel therapeutic intervention and present specific studies demonstrating the cytoprotective effect of this treatment modality.},

	Abstract = {The endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is one of the mediators of smooth muscle (SM) relaxation. The release of NO by endothelium depends on the wall shear stress (WSS) to which endothelium is exposed. During hemodilution or isovolemic exchange transfusion with hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) or volume expanders, the systemic hematocrit, blood viscosity, and blood flow rate are affected that would change WSS at endothelium. The effect of WSS-dependent NO release on SM NO availability has not been determined by direct measurements. We have formulated a mathematical model that is capable of predicting NO concentration in and around arteriolar vessels. The model predicts that the normal physiological SM NO concentration is ???100 nM at a physiological WSS of 24 dyn/cm2 and the NO concentration is linearly dependent on WSS. With volume expanders, the SM NO concentration increases significantly and the levels of SM NO are significantly higher with increase in WSS. The SM NO decreases several-fold even for 5 ??M luminal HBOC. For HBOCs, the NO levels are not restored to normal physiological level even with a significant increase in WSS ({\textgreater}48 dyn/cm2). These predictions are consistent with the results of animal studies of vascular tone following administration of HBOCs and volume expanders. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Administration of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) frequently results in vasoconstriction that is primarily attributed to the scavenging of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) by cell-free hemoglobin. The ensuing pressor response could be caused by the high NO reactivity of HBOC in the vascular lumen and/or the extravasation of hemoglobin molecules. There is a need for quantitative understanding of the NO interaction with HBOC in the blood vessels. We developed a detailed mathematical model of NO diffusion and reaction in the presence of an HBOC for an arteriolar-size vessel. The HBOC reactivity with NO and degree of extravasation was studied in the range of 2-58 x 10(6) M(-1) x s(-1) and 0-100{\%}, respectively. The model predictions showed that the addition of HBOC reduced the smooth muscle (SM) NO concentration in the activation range (12-28 nM) for soluble guanylate cyclase, a major determinant of SM contraction. The SM NO concentration was significantly reduced when the extravasation of HBOC molecules was considered. The myoglobin present in the parenchymal cells scavenges NO, which reduces the SM NO concentration.},

	Abstract = {It is well-known that cyclic variations of the vascular diameter, a phenomenon called vasomotion, are induced by synchronous calcium oscillations of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of the endothelium on vasomotion is unclear. Some experimental studies claim that the endothelium is necessary for synchronization and vasomotion, whereas others report rhythmic contractions in the absence of an intact endothelium. Moreover, endothelium-derived factors have been shown to abolish vasomotion by desynchronizing the calcium signals in SMCs. By modeling the calcium dynamics of a population of SMCs coupled to a population of endothelial cells, we analyze the effects of an SMC vasoconstrictor stimulation on endothelial cells and the feedback of endothelium-derived factors. Our results show that the endothelium essentially decreases the SMCs calcium level and may move the SMCs from a steady state to an oscillatory domain, and vice versa. In the oscillatory domain, a population of coupled SMCs exhibits synchronous calcium oscillations. Outside the oscillatory domain, the coupled SMCs present only irregular calcium flashings arising from noise modeling stochastic opening of channels. Our findings provide explanations for the published contradictory experimental observations.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelium is involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Decreased NO production or availability has been linked to endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Shear stress-induced NO release is a well-established phenomenon, yet the cellular mechanisms of this response are not completely understood. Experimental limitations have hindered direct, real-time measurements of NO under flow conditions. We have overcome these challenges with a new design for a parallel-plate flow chamber. The chamber consists of two compartments, separated by a Transwell?? membrane, which isolates a NO recording electrode located in the upper compartment from flow effects. Endothelial cells are grown on the bottom of the membrane, which is inserted into the chamber flush with the upper plate. We demonstrate for the first time direct real-time NO measurements from endothelial cells with controlled variations in shear stress. Step changes in shear stress from 0.1dyn/cm2 to 6, 10, or 20dyn/cm2 elicited a transient decrease in NO followed by an increase to a new steady state. An analysis of NO transport suggests that the initial decrease is due to the increased removal rate by convection as flow increases. Furthermore, the rate at which the NO concentration approaches the new steady state is related to the time-dependent cellular response rather than transport limitations of the measurement configuration. Our design offers a method for studying the kinetics of the signaling mechanisms linking NO production with shear stress as well as pathological conditions involving changes in NO production or availability. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Optogenetics is increasingly used to map brain activation using techniques that rely on functional hyperaemia, such as opto-fMRI. Here we test whether light stimulation protocols similar to those commonly used in opto-fMRI or to study neurovascular coupling modulate blood flow in mice that do not express light sensitive proteins. Combining two-photon laser scanning microscopy and ultrafast functional ultrasound imaging, we report that in the naive mouse brain, light per se causes a calcium decrease in arteriolar smooth muscle cells, leading to pronounced vasodilation, without excitation of neurons and astrocytes. This photodilation is reversible, reproducible and energy-dependent, appearing at about 0.5 mJ. These results impose careful consideration on the use of photo-activation in studies involving blood flow regulation, as well as in studies requiring prolonged and repetitive stimulations to correct cellular defects in pathological models. They also suggest that light could be used to locally increase blood flow in a controlled fashion.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model of arterial vasomotion in which irregular rhythmic activity is generated by the nonlinear interaction of intracellular and membrane oscillators that depend on cyclic release of Ca2+ from internal stores and cyclic influx of extracellular Ca2+, respectively. Four key control variables were selected on the basis of the pharmacological characteristics of histamine-induced vasomotion in rabbit ear arteries: Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol, Ca2+ concentration in ryanodine-sensitive stores, cell membrane potential, and the open state probability of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Although not represented by independent dynamic variables, the model also incorporates Na+/Ca2+ exchange, the Na+-K+-ATPase, Cl- fluxes, and Ca2+ efflux via the extrusion ATPase. Simulations reproduce a wide spectrum of experimental observations, including 1) the effects of interventions that modulate the functionality of Ca2+ stores and membrane ion channels, 2) paradoxes such as the apparently unpredictable dual action of Ca2+ antagonists and low extracellular Na+ concentration, which can abolish vasomotion or promote the appearance of large-amplitude oscillations, and 3) period-doubling, quasiperiodic, and intermittent routes to chaos. Nonlinearity is essential to explain these diverse patterns of experimental vascular response.},

	Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to examine changes in cerebral metabolism by magnetic resonance imaging of healthy subjects during inhalation of 10{\%} O2 hypoxic air. Hypoxic exposure elevates cerebral perfusion, but its effect on energy metabolism has been less investigated. Magnetic resonance imaging techniques were used to measure global cerebral blood flow and the venous oxygen saturation in the sagittal sinus. Global cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen was quantified from cerebral blood flow and arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference. Concentrations of lactate, glutamate, N-acetylaspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine were measured in the visual cortex by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Twenty-three young healthy males were scanned for 60 min during normoxia, followed by 40 min of breathing hypoxic air. Inhalation of hypoxic air resulted in an increase in cerebral blood flow of 15.5{\%} (p = 0.058), and an increase in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen of 8.5{\%} (p = 0.035). Cerebral lactate concentration increased by 180.3{\%} ([Formula: see text]), glutamate increased by 4.7{\%} ([Formula: see text]) and creatine and phosphocreatine decreased by 15.2{\%} (p[Formula: see text]). The N-acetylaspartate concentration was unchanged (p = 0.36). In conclusion, acute hypoxia in healthy subjects increased perfusion and metabolic rate, which could represent an increase in neuronal activity. We conclude that marked changes in brain homeostasis occur in the healthy human brain during exposure to acute hypoxia.},

@article{Makani2010,
	Abstract = {In hippocampus, synchronous activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons causes a rapid, extracellular, population alkaline transient (PAT). It has been suggested that the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) is the source of this alkalinization, because it exchanges cytosolic Ca(2+) for external H(+). Evidence supporting this hypothesis, however, has thus far been inconclusive. We addressed this long-standing problem by measuring surface alkaline transients (SATs) from voltage-clamped CA1 pyramidal neurons in juvenile mouse hippocampal slices, using concentric (high-speed, low-noise) pH microelectrodes placed against the somata. In saline containing benzolamide (a poorly permeant carbonic anhydrase blocker), a 2-s step from -60 to 0 mV caused a mean SAT of 0.02 unit pH. Addition of 5 mM HEPES to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid diminished the SAT by 91{\%}. Nifedipine reduced the SAT by 53{\%}. Removal of Ca(2+) from the saline abolished the SAT, and addition of BAPTA to the patch pipette reduced it by 79{\%}. The inclusion of carboxyeosin (a PMCA inhibitor) in the pipette abolished the SAT, whether it was induced by a depolarizing step, or by simulated, repetitive, antidromic firing. The peak amplitude of the "antidromic" SAT of a single cell averaged 11{\%} of the PAT elicited by comparable real antidromic activation of the CA1 neuronal population. Caloxin 2A1, an extracellular PMCA peptide inhibitor, blocked both the SAT and PAT by 42{\%}. These results provide the first direct evidence that the PMCA can explain the extracellular alkaline shift elicited by synchronous firing.},

	Abstract = {The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients (essentially glucose). Normal day-to-day life provides a variety of pressure variations in the body and the brain needs to react to these. It does so by varying the resistance of the vasculature, a process known as autoregulation. There are a number of different mechanisms that allow this to occur. Myogenic regulation allows for variations in the arterial radius due to systemic pressure variations. Fluid shear stress exerted on the monocellular layer called the endothelium activates ion channels in both the underlying smooth muscle cells and the endothelium. The ions transported into the cells cause the smooth muscle cells to either contract or dilate. The third mechanism is metabolic in its form. Here the rate of oxygen delivery can allow variations in arteriolar diameters again by cellular variations in calcium ions.We present below numerical and mathematical models which allow investigation of the important pathways, parameters and pathologies of autoregulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {In neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), electron transfer proceeds across domains in a linear sequence from NADPH to flavins to heme, with calmodulin (CaM) triggering the interdomain electron transfer to the heme (Abu-Soud, H. M., and Stuehr, D. J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 10769-10772). Here, we utilized a neuronal NOS devoid of its bound heme and tetrahydrobiopterin (apo-NOS) to examine whether interdomain electron transfer is responsible for CaM's activation of NO synthesis, substrate-independent NADPH oxidation, and cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction. Of the four activities, two (cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction) were similarly stimulated by CaM in apo-NOS when compared with native NOS, indicating that activation occurs by a mechanism not involving flavin-to-heme electron transfer. Further analysis showed that CaM increased the rate of electron transfer from NADPH into the flavin centers by a factor of 20, revealing a direct activation of the NOS reductase domain by CaM. In contrast, CaM's activation of NO synthesis and substrate-independent NADPH oxidation appeared to involve flavin-to-heme electron transfer because these reactions were not activated in apo-NOS and were blocked in native NOS by agents that prevent heme iron reduction. Thus, CaM activates neuronal NOS at two points in the electron transfer sequence: electron transfer into the flavins and interdomain electron transfer between the flavins and heme. Activation at each point is associated with an up-regulation of domain-specific catalytic functions. The dual regulation by CaM is unique and represents a new means by which electron transfer can be controlled in a metalloflavoprotein.},

The challenge is to unravel the link. Here we show, using spectrophotometry to record oxyhaemoglobin and methemoglobin (surrogate markers of cerebral flow and nitric oxide levels respectively) together with extracellular neuronal recordings in vivo and applying a multiple polynomial regression model, that the markers are able to predict up about 80{\%} of variability in NR. Furthermore, we show that the coupling between blood flow and neuronal activity is heavily influenced by nitric oxide (NO). While NRs show the typical saturating response, blood flow shows a linear behaviour during contrast-response curves, with nitric oxide from different sources acting differently for low and high intensity.},

	Abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19{\%} of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82{\%} of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

The model incorporates the conflicting effects of dynamic changes in both blood oxygenation and blood volume. Calculations based on the model show pronounced transients in the deoxyhemoglobin content and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal measured with functional MRI, including initial dips and overshoots and a prolonged poststimulus undershoot of the BOLD signal. Furthermore, these transient effects can occur in the presence of tight coupling of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism throughout the activation period. An initial test of the model against experimental measurements of flow and BOLD changes during a finger-tapping task showed good agreement.},

	Abstract = {In the past two decades, over 1000 clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit in treating stroke, with the exception of thrombolytics. Although many targets have been pursued, including antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor blockers, and neurotrophic factors, often the focus has been on neuronal mechanisms of injury. Broader attention to loss and dysfunction of non-neuronal cell types is now required to increase the chance of success. Of the several glial cell types, this review will focus on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the higher mammalian nervous system, and they play key roles in normal CNS physiology and in central nervous system injury and pathology. In the setting of ischemia astrocytes perform multiple functions, some beneficial and some potentially detrimental, making them excellent candidates as therapeutic targets to improve outcome following stroke and in other central nervous system injuries. The older neurocentric view of the central nervous system has changed radically with the growing understanding of the many essential functions of astrocytes. These include K+ buffering, glutamate clearance, brain antioxidant defense, close metabolic coupling with neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability. In this review, we will focus on those functions of astrocytes that can both protect and endanger neurons, and discuss how manipulating these functions provides a novel and important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral ischemia.},

	Abstract = {The functional and structural integrity of the brain requires local adjustment of blood flow and regulated delivery of metabolic substrates to meet the metabolic demands imposed by neuronal activation. This process-neurovascular coupling-and ensued alterations of glucose and oxygen metabolism-neurometabolic coupling-are accomplished by concerted communication between neural and vascular cells. Evidence suggests that neuronal-derived nitric oxide ((*)NO) is a key player in both phenomena. Alterations in the mechanisms underlying the intimate communication between neural cells and vessels ultimately lead to neuronal dysfunction. Both neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling are perturbed during brain aging and in age-related neuropathologies in close association with cognitive decline. However, despite decades of intense investigation, many aspects remain poorly understood, such as the impact of these alterations. In this review, we address neurovascular and neurometabolic derailment in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), discussing its significance in connection with (*)NO-related pathways.},

When precautions were taken to minimize the sequestration and chelation of 45Ca (i.e., using inhibitors, energy deprivation, and saturation of Ca chelation sites), a diffusion coefficient of 5.3 ?? 10-6 cm2 s-1 was measured. The diffusion coefficient was not appreciably changed by lowering free calcium from 100 ??M to ???10 ??M or by increasing the diffusion time from ten to twenty minutes. In untreated cytoplasm taken directly from the giant axon of Myxicola, the migration of Ca was more complex and could not be described by a single diffusion coefficient. This result is interpreted to suggest that bulk movement of Ca-buffers may occur in untreated Myxicola axoplasm, a system that contains few microtubules. ?? 1987.},

	Abstract = {Individual inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase activity attenuates cortical functional hyperemia evoked by whisker stimulation. The objectives of the present study were to determine (1) if administration of epoxygenase inhibitors attenuates cortical functional hyperemia by using a different modality of sensory activation (i.e., electrical stimulation of the rat forepaw), (2) if epoxygenase inhibition has an additive effect with NO synthase inhibition on the flow response, and (3) the cellular localization of the epoxygenase CYP2C11 in cerebral cortex. In six groups of anesthetized rats, the cortical surface was superfused for 90 minutes with (1) vehicle; (2) 1-mmol/L N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), to inhibit NO synthase activity; (3) 20-mol/L N-methylsulfonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH), a substrate inhibitor of P450 epoxygenase; (4) MS-PPOH plus L-NNA; (5) 20-mol/L miconazole, a reversible inhibitor at the heme site of P450 epoxygenase; and (6) miconazole plus L-NNA. The percent increases in laser-Doppler perfusion over primary sensory cortex during 20-second forepaw stimulation were reduced by 44{\%} to 64{\%} in all drug-treated groups. The addition of L-NNA to MS-PPOH produced no additional reduction (64{\%}) compared with MS-PPOH alone (64{\%}) or L-NNA alone (60{\%}). The addition of L-NNA to miconazole also produced no additional reduction in the flow response. In situ hybridization of CYP2C11 mRNA showed localization in astrocytes, including those adjacent to blood vessels. Thus, activity of both epoxygenase, presumably localized in astrocytes, and NO synthase is required for generating a complete cortical hyperemic response evoked by electrical forepaw stimulation. The lack of additional blood flow attenuation with the combination of the NO synthase and the distinct epoxygenase inhibitors suggests that the signaling pathways do not act in a simple parallel fashion and that other mediators may be involved in coupling cortical blood flow to neuronal activation.},

The procedure is based in the covariance matrix of time resolved activity signals. By determining the time-lag that maximizes covariance one derives the weight of the corresponding connection between cells. Introducing simple constraints, it is possible to conclude if pairs of cells are connected or not and in which direction. After testing the method against synthetic data we apply it to study propagation of {\$}Ca{\^{}}{\{}2+{\}}{\$} waves in astrocytes, with the aim of uncovering the cell connectivity structure. Our method shows to be particularly suited for this type of networking signal propagation where signals are pulse-like and have short time-delays, and is shown to be superior to standard methods, namely a multivariate Granger algorithm. Finally, based the statistical analysis of the connection weight distribution, we propose simple measures for accessing the impact of drugs in the functional connectivity between cells.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ is one of the most important messengers. It transmits signals inside living cells and takes part in intercellular coordination. The dynamics of the Ca2+ concentration shows a transition from elemental, stochastic events to global events like waves and oscillations. This transition renders it an ideal tool for studying basic concepts of pattern formation, especially since access to the most important experimental parameters is given. Ca2+ dynamics in living cells has been a major topic of biophysical modelling in the last 15 years. Modelling has reached the level of predictive power. The theoretical analysis of waves provided new insight into the mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling and led to new concepts of analysis of wave equations with concentration dependent diffusion and novel wave bifurcations. Modelling of oscillations provided understanding especially of complex oscillations and allowed to extract information about the underlying cellular parameters and mechanisms. The investigation of the stochastic aspects of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics demonstrated the fundamental role of fluctuations arising from the control of the release channel by Ca2+ and IP3. This review presents an overview of current theoretical research on Ca2+ dynamics in living cells driven by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channel.},

@article{Sykova2004,
	Abstract = {Extrasynaptic communication between neurons or neurons and glia is mediated by the diffusion of neuroactive substances in the volume of the extracellular space (ECS). The size and irregular geometry of the diffusion channels in the ECS substantially differ not only around individual cells but also in different CNS regions and thus affect and direct the movement of various neuroactive substances in the ECS. Diffusion in the CNS is therefore not only inhomogeneous, but often also anisotropic. The diffusion parameters in adult mammals (including humans), ECS volume fraction {\$}\alpha{\$} ({\$}\alpha{\$}=ECS volume/total tissue volume) and tortuosity {\$}\lambda{\$} ({\$}\lambda{\$} 2=free/apparent diffusion coefficient), are typically 0.20-0.25 and 1.5-1.6, respectively, and as such hinder the diffusion of neuroactive substances and water. These diffusion parameters modulate neuronal signaling, neuron-glia communication and extrasynaptic "volume" transmission. A significant decrease in ECS volume fraction and an increase in diffusion barriers (tortuosity) occur during neuronal activity and pathological states. The changes are often related to cell swelling, cell loss, astrogliosis, the rearrangement of neuronal and astrocytic processes and changes in the extracellular matrix. They are also altered during physiological states such as development, lactation and aging. Plastic changes in ECS volume, tortuosity and anisotropy significantly affect neuron-glia communication, the spatial relation of glial processes toward synapses, glutamate or GABA 'spillover' and synaptic crosstalk. The various changes in tissue diffusivity occurring during many pathological states are important for diagnosis, drug delivery and treatment. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2004 IBRO.

Here, we provide such a theoretical derivation for the volume-diameter and flow-length scaling laws of intraspecific vascular trees. In conjunction with the minimum energy hypothesis, this formulation also results in diameter-length, flow-diameter and flow-volume scaling laws. The intraspecific scaling predicts the volume-diameter power relation with a theoretical exponent of 3, which is validated by the experimental measurements for the three major coronary arterial trees in swine (where a least-squares fit of these measurements has exponents of 2.96, 3 and 2.98 for the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery and right coronary artery trees, respectively). This scaling law as well as others agrees very well with the measured morphometric data of vascular trees in various other organs and species.

	Abstract = {Numerical simulations of unsteady blood flow through a honeycomb network originating at multiple inlets and terminating at multiple outlets are presented and discussed under the assumption that blood behaves as a continuum with variable constitution. Unlike a tree network, the honeycomb network exhibits both diverging and converging bifurcations between branching capillary segments. Numerical results based on a finite difference method demonstrate that as in the case of tree networks considered in previous studies, the cell partitioning law at diverging bifurcations is an important parameter in both steady and unsteady flow. Specifically, a steady flow may spontaneously develop self-sustained oscillations at critical conditions by way of a Hopf bifurcation. Contrary to tree-like networks comprised entirely of diverging bifurcations, the critical parameters for instability in honeycomb networks depend weakly on the system size. The blockage of one or more network segments due to the presence of large cells or the occurrence of capillary constriction may cause flow reversal or trigger a transition to unsteady flow.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that, within a specific cortical unit, fractional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMR(O(2))) are coupled through an invariant relationship during physiological stimulation. This aim was achieved by simultaneously measuring relative changes in these quantities in human primary visual cortex (V1) during graded stimulation with patterns designed to selectively activate different populations of V1 neurons. Primary visual cortex was delineated individually in each subject by using phase-encoded retinotopic mapping. Flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery MRI, in conjunction with blood oxygenation-sensitive MRI and hypercapnic calibration, was used to monitor CBF and CMR(O(2)). The stimuli used included (i) diffuse isoluminant chromatic displays; (ii) high spatial-frequency achromatic luminance gratings; and (iii) radial checkerboard patterns containing both color and luminance contrast modulated at different temporal rates. Perfusion responses to each pattern were graded by varying luminance and/or color modulation amplitudes. For all stimulus types, fractional changes in blood flow and oxygen uptake were found to be linearly coupled in a consistent ratio of approximately 2:1. The most potent stimulus produced CBF and CMR(O(2)) increases of 48 +/- 5{\%} and 25 +/- 4{\%}, respectively, with no evidence of a plateau for oxygen consumption. Estimation of aerobic ATP yields from the observed CMR(O(2)) increases and comparison with the maximum possible anaerobic ATP contribution indicate that elevated energy demands during brain activation are met largely through oxidative metabolism.},

	Abstract = {We propose a novel cluster-based reduced-order modelling (CROM) strategy for unsteady flows. CROM combines the cluster analysis pioneered in Gunzburger's group (Burkardt, Gunzburger {\&} Lee, Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Engng, vol. 196, 2006a, pp. 337-355) and transition matrix models introduced in fluid dynamics in Eckhardt's group (Schneider, Eckhardt {\&} Vollmer, Phys. Rev. E, vol. 75, 2007, art. 066313). CROM constitutes a potential alternative to POD models and generalises the Ulam-Galerkin method classically used in dynamical systems to determine a finite-rank approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator. The proposed strategy processes a time-resolved sequence of flow snapshots in two steps. First, the snapshot data are clustered into a small number of representative states, called centroids, in the state space. These centroids partition the state space in complementary non-overlapping regions (centroidal Voronoi cells). Departing from the standard algorithm, the probabilities of the clusters are determined, and the states are sorted by analysis of the transition matrix. Second, the transitions between the states are dynamically modelled using a Markov process. Physical mechanisms are then distilled by a refined analysis of the Markov process, e.g. using finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) and entropic methods. This CROM framework is applied to the Lorenz attractor (as illustrative example), to velocity fields of the spatially evolving incompressible mixing layer and the three-dimensional turbulent wake of a bluff body. For these examples, CROM is shown to identify non-trivial quasi-attractors and transition processes in an unsupervised manner. CROM has numerous potential applications for the systematic identification of physical mechanisms of complex dynamics, for comparison of flow evolution models, for the identification of precursors to desirable and undesirable events, and for flow control applications exploiting nonlinear actuation dynamics. {\textcopyright}2014 Cambridge University Press.},

	Abstract = {The nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway in the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is an important cellular signaling system for the regulation of VSMC relaxation. We present a mathematical model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this pathway. The model describes the flow of NO-driven signal transduction: NO activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), sGC- and phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cGMP production and degradation, cGMP-mediated regulation of protein targets including the Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channel, and the myosin contractile system. Model simulations reproduce major NO/cGMP-induced VSMC relaxation effects, including intracellular Ca2+ concentration reduction and Ca2+ desensitization of myosin phosphorylation and force generation. Using the model, we examine several testable principles. 1) Rapid sGC desensitization is caused by end-product cGMP feedback inhibition; a large fraction of the steady-state sGC population is in an inactivated intermediate state, and cGMP production is limited well below maximum. 2) NO activates the K(Ca) channel with both cGMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms; moderate NO concentration affects the K(Ca) via the cGMP-dependent pathway, whereas higher NO concentration is accommodated by a cGMP-independent mechanism. 3) Chronic NO synthase inhibition may cause underexpressions of K+ channels including inward rectifier and K(Ca) channels. 4) Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile system is distinguished from Ca2+ sensitivity of myosin phosphorylation. The model integrates these interactions among the heterogeneous components of the NO signaling system and can serve as a general modeling framework for studying NO-mediated VSMC relaxation under various physiological and pathological conditions. New data can be readily incorporated into this framework for interpretation and possible modification and improvement of the model.},

@article{Girouard2006,
	Abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},
