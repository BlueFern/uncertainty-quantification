  abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction is controlled by the Ca2+ and
	Rho kinase signalling pathways. While the SMC Rho kinase system seems
	to be reasonably constant, there is enormous variation with regard
	to the mechanisms responsible for generating Ca2+ signals. One way
	of dealing with this diversity is to consider how this system has
	been adapted to control different SMC functions. Phasic SMCs (vas
	deferens, uterus and bladder) rely on membrane depolarization to
	drive Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This depolarization
	can be induced by neurotransmitters or through the operation of a
	membrane oscillator. Many tonic SMCs (vascular, airway and corpus
	cavernosum) are driven by a cytosolic Ca2+ oscillator that generates
	periodic pulses of Ca2+. A similar oscillator is present in pacemaker
	cells such as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and atypical
	SMCs that control other tonic SMCs (gastrointestinal, urethra, ureter).
	The changes in membrane potential induced by these cytosolic oscillators
	does not drive contraction directly but it functions to couple together
	individual oscillators to provide the synchronization that is a characteristic
	feature of many tonic SMCs.},

	system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps
	in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the
	release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into
	the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts
	for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable

	a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and
	glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully
	emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction
	follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or
	perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest
	that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane
	potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {A mathematical and numerical model is developed for the adhesion of platelets in stagnation point flow. The model provides for a correct representation of the axi-symmetric flow and explicitly uses shear rate to characterise not only the convective transport but also the simple surface reaction mechanism used to model platelet adhesion at the wall surface. Excellent agreement exists between the analytical solution and that obtained by the numerical integration of the full Navier--Stokes equations and decoupled conservation of species equations. It has been shown that for a constant wall reaction rate modelling platelet adhesion the maximum platelet flux occurs at the stagnation point streamline. This is in direct contrast to that found in experiment where the maximum platelet deposition occurs at some distance downstream of the stagnation point. However, if the wall reaction rate is chosen to be dependent on the wall shear stress then the analysis shows that the maximum platelet flux occurs downstream of the stagnation point, providing a more realistic model of experimental evidence. The analytical formulation is applicable to a large number of two-dimensional and axi-symmetrical surface reaction flows where the wall shear stress is known a priori.},

abstract = {ACh and KCl stimulate vasomotor responses that spread rapidly and bidirectionally along arteriole walls, most likely via spread of electric current or Ca2+ through gap junctions. We examined these possibilities with isolated, cannulated, and perfused hamster cheek pouch arterioles (50- to 80-microm resting diameter). After intraluminal loading of 2 microM fluo 3 to measure Ca2+ or 1 microM di-8-ANEPPS to measure membrane potential, photometric techniques were used to selectively measure changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) or membrane potential in endothelial cells. Activation of the endothelium by micropipette application of ACh (10-4 M, 1.0-s pulse) to a short segment of arteriole (100-200 microm) increased endothelial cell [Ca2+]i and caused hyperpolarization at the site of stimulation. This response was followed rapidly by vasodilation of the entire arteriole ( approximately 2-mm length). Change in membrane potential always preceded dilation, both at the site of stimulation and at distant sites along the arteriole. In contrast, an increase in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i was observed only at the application site. Micropipette application of KCl, which can depolarize both smooth muscle and endothelial cells (250 mM, 2.5-s pulse), also caused a rapid, spreading response consisting of depolarization followed by vasoconstriction. With KCl stimulation, in addition to changes in membrane potential, increases in endothelial cell [Ca2+]i were observed at distant sites not directly exposed to KCl. The rapid longitudinal spread of both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses support electrical coupling as the mode of signal transmission along the arteriolar length. In addition, the relatively short distance between heterologous cell types enables the superimposed radial Ca2+ signaling between smooth muscle and endothelial cells to modulate vasomotor responses.},

abstract = {Investigating the recruitment and synchronization of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is the key to understanding the physical mechanisms leading to contraction and spontaneous diameter oscillations of arteries, called vasomotion. We improved a method that allows the correlation of calcium oscillations (flashing) of individual SMCs with mean calcium variations and arterial contraction using confocal microscopy. Endothelium-stripped rat mesenteric arteries were cut open, loaded with dual calcium fluorescence probes, and stimulated by increasing concentrations of the vasoconstrictors phenylephrine (PE) and KCl. We found that the number and synchronization of flashing cells depends on vasoconstrictor concentration. At low vasoconstrictor concentration, few cells flash asynchronously and no local contraction is detected. At medium concentration, recruitment of cells is complete and synchronous, leading to strip contraction after KCl stimulation and to vasomotion after PE stimulation. High concentration of PE leads to synchronous calcium oscillations and fully contracted vessels, whereas high concentration of KCl leads to a sustained nonoscillating increase of calcium and to fully contracted vessels. We conclude that the number of simultaneously recruited cells is an important factor in controlling rat mesenteric artery contraction and vasomotion.},

abstract = {Vasomotion consists of cyclic arterial diameter variations induced by synchronous contractions and relaxations of smooth muscle cells. However, the arteries do not contract simultaneously on macroscopic distances, and a propagation of the contraction can be observed. In the present study, our aim was to investigate this propagation. We stimulated endothelium-denuded rat mesenteric arterial strips with phenylephrine (PE) to obtain vasomotion and observed that the contraction waves are linked to intercellular calcium waves. A velocity of approximately 100 microm/s was measured for the two kinds of waves. To investigate the calcium wave propagation mechanisms, we used a method allowing a PE stimulation of a small area of the strip. No calcium propagation could be induced by this local stimulation when the strip was in its resting state. However, if a low PE concentration was added on the whole strip, local PE stimulations induced calcium waves, spreading over finite distances. The calcium wave velocity induced by local stimulation was identical to the velocity observed during vasomotion. This suggests that the propagation mechanisms are similar in the two cases. Using inhibitors of gap junctions and of voltage-operated calcium channels, we showed that the locally induced calcium propagation likely depends on the propagation of the smooth muscle cell depolarization. Finally, we proposed a model of the propagation mechanisms underlying these intercellular calcium waves.},

abstract = {A system of differential equations describing stationary vasomotion is formulated. It incorporates the ionic transports, cell-membrane potential, muscle contraction of the vessel smooth muscle cells, and the mechanics of a thick-walled cylinder. It is shown that the interaction of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes mediated by voltage-gated and voltage-calcium-gated channels, respectively, brings about periodicity of those transports. This results on a time-periodic cytoplasmic calcium concentration, myosin light chains phosphorylation, and crossbridges formation with the attending muscle stress. The vessel's transmural pressure determines a hoop stress. The resultant hoop, elastic, and muscle stresses determine the rate of change of the vessel's diameter: vasomotion. The model results agree with the experimental observations. The sensitivity of the vasomotion's dependence on parameter values and its significance to experimental protocols are examined. Further, it is hypothesized that the dependence of calcium-channel openings on voltage is shifted by changes on transmural pressure. Thus, Harder's experimental results are reproduced, among them the decreasing of vessel diameter with increasing pressure. Those behaviors are associated with a pattern of change of the singularities of the system of equations describing the model. This suggests a functional relationship on the interactions of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes responsible for the myogenic response; it may not result from a single molecular mechanism. The model is constructed so that additional experimental information can be readily incorporated.},

abstract = {Connexins (Cxs) 40, 43, and 45 are expressed in many different tissues, but most abundantly in the heart, blood vessels, and the nervous system. We examined formation and gating properties of heterotypic gap junction (GJ) channels assembled between cells expressing wild-type Cx40, Cx43, or Cx45 and their fusion forms tagged with color variants of green fluorescent protein. We show that these Cxs, with exception of Cxs 40 and 43, are compatible to form functional heterotypic GJ channels. Cx40 and Cx43 hemichannels are unable or effectively impaired in their ability to dock and/or assemble into junctional plaques. When cells expressing Cx45 contacted those expressing Cx40 or Cx43 they readily formed junctional plaques with cell-cell coupling characterized by asymmetric junctional conductance dependence on transjunctional voltage, V(j). Cx40/Cx45 heterotypic GJ channels preferentially exhibit V(j)-dependent gating transitions between open and residual states with a conductance of approximately 42 pS; transitions between fully open and closed states with conductance of approximately 52 pS in magnitude occur at substantially lower ( approximately 10-fold) frequency. Cx40/Cx45 junctions demonstrate electrical signal transfer asymmetry that can be modulated between unidirectional and bidirectional by small changes in the difference between holding potentials of the coupled cells. Furthermore, both fast and slow gating mechanisms of Cx40 exhibit a negative gating polarity.},

abstract = {In the vessel wall, endothelial cells are metabolically and electrically coupled to each other and to the adjacent smooth muscle cells by gap junctions composed of connexins. Gap junctions may be formed from combinations of several different connexin proteins, and deletion of one connexin can lead to modification of the expression of another. To reveal a possible interaction between connexin40 (Cx40) and connexin43 (Cx43) in endothelium, we studied their distribution in vessels from C57Bl/6 and Cx40 knockout mice (Cx40-/-) using immunoblots and immunocytochemistry on aortic cross sections and en face whole mounts. En face preparations from C57Bl/6 mice revealed two distinct pools of Cx43, one pericellular and the other intracellular. Cx40 was largely restricted to the periphery of the cells, and in Cx40-/- mice it was, as expected, undetectable. In the Cx40-/- mice, total Cx43 protein was also modestly reduced (immunoblots), but there was a major redistribution of the protein within the cell. The pericellular component of Cx43 was rendered virtually undetectable, and the intracellular compartments were normal or even slightly elevated. Smooth muscle Cx43 was also reduced in the Cx40-/- animals. These findings indicate that the cellular distribution of Cx43 is dependent on the presence of Cx40, and in view of the profound effects on the pericellular pool of the Cx43, the findings suggest that interactions between Cx40 and Cx43 regulate communication between endothelial cells and perhaps between smooth muscle and endothelial cells as well.},

This system of communication allows cells to monitor the functional state of their neighbours, and is rapidly modulated to continuously adapt to the immediate needs of groups of coupled cells. In the major arteries, endothelial cells may express three connexins isotypes, namely Connexin 37 (Cx37), Cx40 and Cx43, whereas the underlying smooth muscle cells may express Cx37, Cx40, Cx43 and Cx45. Moreover, myoendothelial gap junctions have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of vascular tone. This review highlights the regulation of vessel connexins in response to injury, as observed during experimental hypertension or wound repair, as well as the consequences of loss of one connexin in different transgenic null mice. In view of the major endocrine role of the kidney in the control of blood pressure, we also discuss the distribution of connexins in the kidney vasculature. Cx40 is present between endothelial cells of vessels and glomeruli, as well as between renin-secreting cells, the modified smooth muscle cells which form the wall of the terminal part of afferent arterioles. Modulation of Cx40 expression in a model of renin-dependent hypertension suggests that this connexin may be implicated in the function of renin-secreting cells. Finally, to address the possible regulation of connexin expression by fluid pressure, we summarize the effects of elevated transmural urine pressure on bladder Cx43 expression.},

abstract = {Gap junctions play essential roles in the normal function of the heart and arteries, mediating the spread of the electrical impulse that stimulates synchronized contraction of the cardiac chambers, and contributing to co-ordination of activities between cells of the arterial wall. In common with other multicellular systems, cardiovascular tissues express multiple connexin isotypes that confer distinctive channel properties. This review highlights how state-of-the-art immunocytochemical and cellular imaging techniques, as part of a multidisciplinary approach in gap junction research, have advanced our understanding of connexin diversity in cardiovascular cell function in health and disease. In the heart, spatially defined patterns of expression of three connexin isotypes-connexin43, connexin40, and connexin45-underlie the precisely orchestrated patterns of current flow governing the normal cardiac rhythm. Derangement of gap junction organization and/or reduced expression of connexin43 are associated with arrhythmic tendency in the diseased human ventricle, and high levels of connexin40 in the atrium are associated with increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation after coronary by-pass surgery. In the major arteries, endothelial gap junctions may simultaneously express three connexin isotypes, connexin40, connexin37, and connexin43; underlying medial smooth muscle, by contrast, predominantly expresses connexin43, with connexin45 additionally expressed at restricted sites. In normal arterial smooth muscle, the abundance of connexin43 gap junctions varies according to vascular site, and shows an inverse relationship with desmin expression and positive correlation with the quantity of extracellular matrix. Increased connexin43 expression between smooth muscle cells is closely linked to phenotypic transformation in early human coronary atherosclerosis and in the response of the arterial wall to injury. Current evidence thus suggests that gap junctions in both their guises, as pathways for cell-to-cell signaling in the vessel wall and as pathways for impulse conduction in the heart, contribute to the initial pathogenesis and eventual clinical manifestation of human cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Cellular interaction in blood vessels is maintained by multiple communication pathways, including gap junctions. They consist of intercellular channels ensuring direct interaction between endothelial and smooth muscle cells and the synchronization of their behavior along the vascular wall. Gap-junction channels arise from the docking of two hemichannels or connexons, formed by the assembly of six connexins, and achieve direct cellular communication by allowing the transport of small metabolites, second messengers, and ions between two adjacent cells. Physiologic variations in connexin expression are observed along the vascular tree, with most common connexins being Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43. Changes in the level of expression of connexins have been correlated to the development of vascular disease, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, or restenosis. Recent studies on connexin-deficient mice highlighted key roles of these communication pathways in the development of these pathologies and confirmed the need for targeted pharmacologic approaches for their prevention and treatment. The aim of this issue is to review the current knowledge on the implication of gap junctions in vascular function and most common cardiovascular diseases.},

It is the crucial difference between isolated cells and intact tissue. Cells communicate in various ways with each other; these include the release of chemical transmitters, hormones and mediators as well as direct electrical and chemical intercellular communication via gap junction channels. The gap junction coupling is important for the organization of the tissue as an electrical syncytium and for accurate development. Pharmacological modulation of these channels could be important in the fields of arrhythmogenesis, vasomotion and cell differentiation. In this review, Stefan Dhein outlines the structure, synthesis and function of gap junction channels.

abstract = {Integration and coordination of responses among vascular wall cells are critical to the local modulation of vasomotor tone and to the maintenance of circulatory homeostasis. This article reviews the vast literature concerning the principles that govern the initiation and propagation of vasoactive stimuli among vascular smooth muscle cells, which are nominally the final effectors of vasomotor tone. In light of the abundance of new information concerning the distribution and function of gap junctions between vascular wall cells throughout the vascular tree, particular attention is paid to this integral aspect of vascular physiology. Evidence is provided for the important contribution of intercellular communication to vascular function at all levels of the circulation, from the largest elastic artery to the terminal arterioles. The thesis of this review is that the presence of gap junctions, in concert with the autonomic nervous system, pacemaker cells, myogenic mechanisms, and/or electrotonic current spread (both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing waves through gap junctions), confers a plasticity, adaptability, and flexibility to vasculature that may well account for the observed diversity in regulation and function of vascular tissues throughout the vascular tree. It is hoped that the summary information provided here will serve as a launching pad for a new discourse on the mechanistic basis of the integrative regulation and function of vasculature, which painstakingly accounts for the undoubtedly complex and manifold role of gap junctions in vascular physiology/dysfunction.},

abstract = {The effect of cyclic blood flow velocity on local tissue oxygenation was studied by means of a mathematical simulation in the situation where red blood cells (RBC) act as discrete oxygen sources. Cyclic time varying fluctuations of capillary blood (flowmotion) are due to arteriolar vasomotion. This effect was introduced into the model as an oscillating RBC velocity with equal periods of high and low velocity regulated by a square wave function. Changes in RBC velocity coupled with a constant time-average capillary hematocrit lead to periods of high and low flux. Input parameters were flowmotion frequency and amplitude, capillary hematocrit, and mean RBC velocity. All results were related to baseline states where the velocity and hematocrit are steady. Our principle finding is that flowmotion alters the tissue oxygenation, whereby: 1) high amplitudes of flowmotion cause a modest increase in axial delivery of oxygen but with a decreased average tissue pO2; 2) decreasing flowmotion frequencies lead to increased radial penetration of oxygen; 3) the lower frequencies of flowmotion cause an increase in the volume of tissue that achieves at least a pO2 level of 5 mmHg. Isovolemic hemodilution was simulated and found to substantially increase the volume of oxygenated tissue as a function of flowmotion. These findings indicate that pO2 transients caused by flowmotion oxygenate tissue domains which under steady-state conditions would remain anoxic.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that vasomotion, the rhythmic contraction exhibited by small arteries and arterioles, is impaired in diabetic subjects compared with healthy control subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We mathematically modeled the oscillations in laser Doppler microvascular measurements taken from the pulpar surface of the index finger in 20 healthy control subjects and 20 age-matched diabetic subjects (8 with type I and 12 with type II diabetes). The mean duration of diabetes was 17.1 +/- 2.3 years, and mean HbA1c was 9.1 +/- 0.4\%. Blood flow was measured for 5 min as subjects rested quietly in a closed room. Fast Fourier transformation was performed to provide the frequency power spectrum of each recording. Amplitude of vasomotion was correlated with six quantitative measurements of neuropathy. RESULTS: Diabetic subjects had impaired low-frequency oscillation vasomotion in 75\% of age-matched patients (15 of 20 patients), with mean amplitudes of 24.9 +/- 6.4 vs. 129.0 +/- 33.2 (P < 0.0039). Of six somatic and autonomic neuropathy variables, only the warm thermal sensory threshold correlated significantly with the mean amplitude of vasomotion (r = -0.75, P < 0.0009). CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of peripheral vasomotion are clearly disordered in diabetes. The loss of low-frequency oscillations observed here suggests a peripheral vascular abnormality that extends past the capillary network to arterial vessels. It is uncertain whether the accompanying small unmyelinated nerve C-fiber dysfunction is a cause or consequence of the impaired microvascular function. Measurement of vasomotion may prove useful as a novel test for peripheral neurovascular function.},

To elucidate the ionic mechanism of this rhythmic behaviour, rabbit mesenteric arterial rings were suspended in an organ chamber for isometric tension studies. Yohimbine, propranolol, and atropine had no effect on these contractions, minimizing the possibility that transmitter release from nerve terminals was involved. Additionally, the oscillatory contractions were not altered by diphenhydramine, cimetidine, and indomethacin, thus ruling out the involvement of histamine and prostaglandins. This oscillatory response was completely abolished after the removal of extracellular Ca 2+, as well as after Ca 2+ channel blockade by diltiazem or nifedipine. Sparteine and quinidine, Ca 2+-activated K+ channel antagonists, also abolished the oscillation. In contrast, tetraethylammonium and 3,4-diaminopyridine, voltage-dependent K+ channel antagonists, augmented the response. Glibenclamide, an antagonist of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, had no effect on the rhythmic contractions. These results suggest that the rhythmic contractions observed in rabbit mesenteric arteries after ryanodine treatment were caused by the movement of Ca 2+ and K+ across the plasmalemma via the voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channel and the Ca 2+-activated K+ channel, respectively.},

We focused on the relationships between hemorheological alterations and cerebral TOI in sickle cell patients with no cerebral vasculopathy and on the usefulness of TOI variability to assess the cerebral vasomotion activity. The blood rheological profile, the level of cerebral TOI (spatial resolved spectroscopy) and the cerebral TOI variability, which reflects vasomotion activity, were compared between 20 healthy subjects (AA), 21 SC patients, and 21 SS patients. Cerebral TOI exhibited the following order: AA > SC > SS. The low cerebral TOI in SS patients was related to red blood cell aggregation and deformability properties. The cerebral TOI variability of SS and SC patients was increased above healthy values and vasomotion activity was negatively associated with the reduced cerebral TOI in SS patients. We demonstrated that (1) blood rheology could be involved in the reduced cerebral TOI in SS patients but not in SC patients; (2) vasomotion activity is increased in SS and SC patients to compensate for the reduced cerebral TOI.},

It is observed clinically through related flow variations (flux motion) which are detected by laser Doppler flowmetry. It presents two distinct regimens: slow and fast waves, with frequencies of 1-2 and 10-20 cpm, respectively. Both activities are found in normal tissues, and their rate of incidence as well as their magnitude become significantly enhanced during abnormal conditions associated with low blood pressure and hypoperfusion. The institution of this activity by abnormal tissue conditions suggests that vasomotion is a reaction of the microcirculation aimed at improving microvascular function.},

abstract = {Many experimental studies have shown that arterial smooth muscle cells respond with cytosolic calcium rises to vasoconstrictor stimulation. A low vasoconstrictor concentration gives rise to asynchronous spikes in the calcium concentration in a few cells (asynchronous flashing). With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffusion does not play an important role to achieve synchronization. Our model is validated by published in vitro experiments obtained on rat mesenteric arterial segments.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in [Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

Cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and membrane potential (V(m)) play important roles in this process by controlling EC-dependent vasoactive signals and intercellular communication. The present mathematical model integrates plasmalemma electrophysiology and Ca(2+) dynamics to investigate EC responses to different stimuli and the controversial relationship between [Ca(2+)](i) and V(m). The model contains descriptions for the intracellular balance of major ionic species and the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. It also expands previous formulations by including more detailed transmembrane current descriptions. The model reproduces V(m) responses to volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) blockers and extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)](o)) challenges, predicting 1) that V(m) changes upon VRAC blockade are [K(+)](o) dependent and 2) a biphasic response of V(m) to increasing [K(+)](o). Simulations of agonist-induced Ca(2+) mobilization replicate experiments under control and V(m) hyperpolarization blockade conditions. They show that peak [Ca(2+)](i) is governed by store Ca(2+) release while Ca(2+) influx (and consequently V(m)) impacts more the resting and plateau [Ca(2+)](i). The V(m) sensitivity of rest and plateau [Ca(2+)](i) is dictated by a [Ca(2+)](i) "buffering" system capable of masking the V(m)-dependent transmembrane Ca(2+) influx. The model predicts plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase and Ca(2+) permeability as main players in this process. The heterogeneous V(m) impact on [Ca(2+)](i) may elucidate conflicting reports on how V(m) influences EC Ca(2+). The present study forms the basis for the development of multicellular EC-SMC models that can assist in understanding vascular autoregulation in health and disease.},

abstract = {This study presents a multicellular computational model of a rat mesenteric arteriole to investigate the signal transduction mechanisms involved in the generation of conducted vasoreactivity. The model comprises detailed descriptions of endothelial (ECs) and smooth muscle (SM) cells (SMCs), coupled by nonselective gap junctions. With strong myoendothelial coupling, local agonist stimulation of the EC or SM layer causes local changes in membrane potential (V(m)) that are conducted electrotonically, primarily through the endothelium. When myoendothelial coupling is weak, signals initiated in the SM conduct poorly, but the sensitivity of the SMCs to current injection and agonist stimulation increases. Thus physiological transmembrane currents can induce different levels of local V(m) change, depending on cell's gap junction connectivity. The physiological relevance of current and voltage clamp stimulations in intact vessels is discussed. Focal agonist stimulation of the endothelium reduces cytosolic calcium (intracellular Ca(2+) concentration) in the prestimulated SM layer. This SMC Ca(2+) reduction is attributed to a spread of EC hyperpolarization via gap junctions. Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, but not Ca(2+), diffusion through homocellular gap junctions can increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in neighboring ECs. The small endothelial Ca(2+) spread can amplify the total current generated at the local site by the ECs and through the nitric oxide pathway, by the SMCs, and thus reduces the number of stimulated cells required to induce distant responses. The distance of the electrotonic and Ca(2+) spread depends on the magnitude of SM prestimulation and the number of SM layers. Model results are consistent with experimental data for vasoreactivity in rat mesenteric resistance arteries.},

abstract = {In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. \& Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. \& Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.},

abstract = {Gap junctions composed of connexin-45 (Cx45) homologs from four species, zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human, were expressed in pairs of Xenopus oocytes. The macroscopic conductance (gj) of all Cx45 junctions was modulated by transjunctional voltage (Vj) and by the inside-outside voltage (Vm), and the modulation was species specific. Although their gating characteristics varied in voltage sensitivity and kinetics, the four Cx45 junctions shared 1) maximum conductance at Vj = 0 and symmetrical gj reduction in response to positive and negative Vj of low amplitude, with little residual conductance; and 2) gj increases in response to simultaneous depolarization of the paired cells. The formation of hybrid channels, comprising Cx45 hemichannels from different species, allowed us to infer that two separate gates exist, one in each hemichannel, and that each Cx45 hemichannel is closed by the negativity of Vj on its cytoplasmic side. Interestingly, the Vm dependence of hybrid channels also suggests the presence of two gates in series, one Vm gate in each hemichannel. Thus the Vj and Vm dependence provides evidence that two independent voltage gates in each Cx45 hemichannel exist, reacting through specific voltage sensors and operating by different mechanisms, properties that have evolved divergently among species.},

abstract = {The spontaneous and rhythmic constriction of peripheral arterioles, which is not associated with the cardiac or respiratory cycles, is called vasomotion. Vasomotion is observed in various tissues of various species, but the physiological role of vasomotion has not been clarified because of the difficulty in controlling the appearance of vasomotion in in vivo preparations. We developed a method of controlling vasomotion in in vivo experiments. The electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve could reproducibly evoke vasomotion in rabbit ear skin. The frequencies of the evoked vasomotion were 0.04-0.07 Hz, which corresponded to spontaneously occurring vasomotion that has been reported before. Vasomotion was always evoked between 25 and 35 degrees C. At lower than 17 degrees C or higher than 37 degrees C, vasomotion was not evoked. With the use of this method of evoking vasomotion in vivo, the role of vasomotion in tissue perfusion was examined. A tracer (Cr-EDTA) was injected into the ear tissue, and tracer fading was then measured by using a camera. The rates of fading (clearance) of the tracer with vasomotion were significantly greater (1.7 to 8.1 times) than those without vasomotion. These results provided evidence that vasomotion enhanced tissue perfusion.},

abstract = {Vascular cells communicate electrically to coordinate their activity and control tissue blood flow. To foster a quantitative understanding of this fundamental process, we developed a computational model that was structured to mimic a skeletal muscle resistance artery. Each endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell in our virtual artery was treated as the electrical equivalent of a capacitor coupled in parallel with a non-linear resistor representing ionic conductance; intercellular gap junctions were represented by ohmic resistors. Simulations revealed that the vessel wall is not a syncytium in which electrical stimuli spread equally to all constitutive cells. Indeed, electrical signals spread in a differential manner among and between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells according to the initial stimulus. The predictions of our model agree with physiological data from the feed artery of the hamster retractor muscle. Cell orientation and coupling resistance were the principal factors that enable electrical signals to spread differentially along and between the two cell types. Our computational observations also illustrated how gap junctional coupling enables the vessel wall to filter and transform transient electrical events into sustained voltage responses. Functionally, differential electrical communication would permit discrete regions of smooth muscle activity to locally regulate blood flow and the endothelium to coordinate regional changes in tissue perfusion.},

abstract = {Electrical communication and its role in blood flow regulation are built on an examination of charge movement in single, isolated vessels. How this process behaves in broader arterial networks remains unclear. This study examined the nature of electrical communication in arterial structures where vessel length and branching were varied. Analysis began with the deployment of an existing computational model expanded to form a variable range of vessel structures. Initial simulations revealed that focal endothelial stimulation generated electrical responses that conducted robustly along short unbranched vessels and to a lesser degree lengthened arteries or branching structures retaining a single branch point. These predictions matched functional observations from hamster mesenteric arteries and support the idea that an increased number of vascular cells attenuate conduction by augmenting electrical load. Expanding the virtual network to 31 branches revealed that electrical responses increasingly ascended from fifth- to first-order arteries when the number of stimulated distal vessels rose. This property enabled the vascular network to grade vasodilation and network perfusion as revealed through blood flow modeling. An elevation in endothelial-endothelial coupling resistance, akin to those in sepsis models, compromised this ascension of vasomotor/perfusion responses. A comparable change was not observed when the endothelium was focally disrupted to mimic disease states including atherosclerosis. In closing, this study highlights that vessel length and branching play a role in setting the conduction of electrical phenomenon along resistance arteries and within networks. It also emphasizes that modest changes in endothelial function can, under certain scenarios, impinge on network responsiveness and blood flow control.},

abstract = {Vasomotion is a rhythmic variation in microvascular diameter. Although known for more than 150 years, the cellular processes underlying the initiation of vasomotion are not fully understood. In the present study a model of a single cell is extended by coupling a number of cells into a tube. The simulated results point to a permissive role of cGMP in establishing intercellular synchronization. In sufficient concentration, cGMP may activate a cGMP-sensitive calcium-dependent chloride channel, causing a tight spatiotemporal coupling between release of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium, membrane depolarization, and influx of extracellular calcium. Low [cGMP] is associated only with unsynchronized waves. At intermediate concentrations, cells display either waves or whole cell oscillations, but these remain unsynchronized between cells. Whole cell oscillations are associated with rhythmic variation in membrane potential and flow of current through gap junctions. The amplitude of these oscillations in potential grows with increasing [cGMP], and, past a certain threshold, they become strong enough to entrain all cells in the vascular wall, thereby initiating sustained vasomotion. In this state there is a rhythmic flow of calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels into the cytoplasm, making the frequency of established vasomotion sensitive to membrane potential. It is concluded that electrical coupling through gap junctions is likely to be responsible for the rapid synchronization across a large number of cells. Gap-junctional current between cells is due to the appearance of oscillations in the membrane potential that again depends on the entrainment of sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane within the individual cell.},

Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

Coupling from glutamatergic synapses to smooth muscle cells of arterioles is effected by astrocytes releasing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) onto them, following glutamate stimulation of the astrocyte. Coupling of EETs to the smooth muscle of arterioles is by means of potassium channels in their membranes, leading to hyperpolarization, relaxation and hence an increase in blood flow.

There was an increase in local hypothalamic blood flow if the 133Xe-containing solution was HCO3--free; raising the [HCO--3,] of the solution to 40 mM caused a fall in local blood flow. 3.

abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"-the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15\% arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling. � 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Normal brain function requires proper supply of oxygen and glucose in a timely and local manner. This is achieved through an orchestrated intercellular communication between neurones, astrocytes and microvessels that results in a rapid and restricted increase in cerebral blood flow, a process known as neurovascular coupling. Astrocytic end-feet make close contacts with neuronal synapses and blood vessels and, given their ability to release vasoactive signals following neuronal activation, have been recognized as key intermediaries in the neurovascular response. Both dilating and constricting signals appear to be released from astrocytes upon increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and both dilatation and constriction of brain vessels have been observed in previous studies. In this article, we discuss the various astrocyte-derived vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals, their interactions and effects on astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and suggest the importance of the intrinsic properties of the latter cell type on the overall neurovascular response. We present a working model in which the rise in astrocytic Ca(2+) following neuronal activation leads not only to the rapid activation of calcium-activated K(+) channels in astrocytic end-feet, but also to their modulation by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway, which in general have been proposed to act on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than on astrocytes. We propose that this latter mechanism may in turn modulate K(+) signalling from astrocytes to smooth muscle cells, influencing the overall effects of the vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals released during neuronal activation.},

However, only recently were in vivo studies undertaken to determine whether high-K
                        + exposure damages neurons. We implanted microdialysis probes into rat amygdalae bilaterally, and after 2-h baseline period exposed one side to a modified Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate solution containing 100 mmol/l KCl for 30, 50 and 70 min, followed by a 2-h recovery period, and 70 min and 3 h without a recovery period. Of 100.9 � 2.0 mmol/l KCl, 12.0 � 1.0\% was extracted by amygdalar tissue in vivo. Elevation of the extracellular K
                        + concentration in the amygdala for 70 min or longer without a recovery period produced extensive neuronal damage and edematous-appearing neuropil in the tissue dialysed, as well as loss of normal neurons. Histological evidence of edema subsided in the groups with a 2-h recovery period. Although the number of damaged neurons was not significantly higher in the group with a 70 min high-K
                        + exposure and 2-h recovery period, the number of normal neurons was reduced, suggesting cell loss. During 70-min high-K

Extracellular serine was decreased at 20, 50 and 70 min of high-K

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

Alterations of these vascular regulatory mechanisms lead to brain dysfunction and disease.

abstract = {Neuronal activity is thought to communicate to arterioles in the brain through astrocytic calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling to cause local vasodilation. Paradoxically, this communication may cause vasoconstriction in some cases. Here, we show that, regardless of the mechanism by which astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) was elevated, modest increases in Ca(2+) induced dilation, whereas larger increases switched dilation to constriction. Large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive potassium channels in astrocytic endfeet mediated a majority of the dilation and the entire vasoconstriction, implicating local extracellular K(+) as a vasoactive signal for both dilation and constriction. These results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism that explains the nature and apparent duality of the vascular response, showing that the degree and polarity of neurovascular coupling depends on astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) and perivascular K(+).},

MCAs (200-250 $\mu$m OD) were isolated, cannulated with glass micropipettes, and pressurized. K+ was increased in the extraluminal bath using three paradigms: (1) isotonic K+ (K(iso)) where increases in K+ were offset by decreases in Na+, (2) hypertonic K+ (K(hyper)) where K+ was increased without a concomitant adjustment of Na+, and (3) K(suc), a solution using K(iso) but with the addition of sucrose to obtain a hypertonic solution. Increases in K+ in the extraluminal bath produced significant dilations (approximately 20\%) at 21 mM K+ in all three groups (K(iso), K(hyper), and K(suc)). With the K(hyper) and K(suc) groups, the magnitude of the dilation diminished with further increases in K+. L-NAME (10-5 M), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, had no effect on the response of the K(hyper) and K(suc) groups at 21 mM but significantly enhanced constrictions of the MCAs above 40 mM K+ compared to the control. The K(iso) group was not affected by L-NAME at any K+ concentration and showed profound constrictions above 40 mM K+. We conclude that changes in the K+ concentration and osmolality of the extracellular fluid may have profound effects on the cerebral vasculature. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slow-moving ionic and metabolic disturbance that propagates in cortical brain tissue. In addition to massive cellular depolarizations, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and metabolism-aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on modeling the features essential to understanding the implications of neurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium-ATPase, mainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a rate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is determined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an effective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium concentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex exceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of vascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation play important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model replicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD-vasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation, prolonged depolarization-found in experimental studies. We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the contribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the variability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These results have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more precise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly relevant to neurological disease.},

abstract = {In spite of five decades of study, the biophysics of spreading depression (SD) is incompletely understood. Earlier we have modeled seizures and SD, and we have shown that currents through ion channels normally present in neuron membranes can generate SD-like depolarization. In the present study, we define the conditions for triggering SD and the parameters that influence its course in a model of a hippocampal pyramidal cell with more complete representation of ions and channels than the previous version. "Leak" conductances for Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) and an ion pump were present in the membrane of the entire cell; fast inactivating voltage dependent conductances for sodium and potassium in the soma; "persistent" conductances in soma and apical dendrite, and K(+)- and voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-controlled conductance in the apical dendrite. The neuron was surrounded by restricted interstitial space and by a "glia-endothelium" system of extracellular ion regulation bounded by a membrane having leak conductances and an ion pump. Ion fluxes and concentration changes were continuously computed as well as osmotic cell volume changes. As long as reuptake into the neuron and "buffering" by glia kept pace with K(+) released from the neuron, stimulating current applied to the soma evoked repetitive firing that stopped when stimulation ceased. When glial uptake was reduced, K(+) released from neurons could accumulate in the interstitium and keep the neuron depolarized so that strong depolarizing pulses injected into the soma were followed either by afterdischarge or SD. SD-like depolarization was ignited when depolarization spreading into the apical dendrite, activated persistent Na(+) current and NMDA-controlled current. With membrane parameters constant, varying the injected stimulating current influenced SD onset but neither the depolarization nor the increase in extracellular K(+). Glial "leak" conductance influenced SD duration and SD ignition point. Varying maximal conductances (representing channel density) also influenced SD onset time but not the amplitude of the depolarization. Hypoxia was simulated by turning off the Na-K exchange pump, and this resulted in SD-like depolarization. The results confirm that, once ignited, SD runs an all-or-none trajectory, the level of depolarization is governed by feedback involving ion shifts and glutamate acting on ion channels and not by the number of channels open, and SD is ignited if the net persistent membrane current in the apical dendrites turns inward.},

Activation of NMDA receptors in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus by paired and multiple stimuli occurred here with orthodromic stimulation at 10 Hz. Elevating extracellular potassium ion concentration ([K+)(o)) to 7.5 mM selectively enhanced the NMDA receptor-mediated component of the response to repetitive stimulation, and led to burst-firing of pyramidal cells. The effects of elevated [K+](o) on NMDA receptor activation were accompanied by relatively small changes in resting potential, however, and may in part result from a decrease in the potassium equilibrium potential producing slowed repolarization. Supporting this hypothesis, low concentrations of the K+-channel blocker tetraethylammonium added to normal [K+](o) solution slowed repolarization and reproduced the effects of elevated [K+](o) on NMDA receptor activation. Significant changes in [K+](o) occur with neuronal activity in the central nervous system, and thus may play a role in regulating NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic activity.},

abstract = {Smooth muscle and endothelial cells in the arterial wall are exposed to mechanical stress. Indeed blood flow induces intraluminal pressure variations and shear stress. An increase in pressure may induce a vessel contraction, a phenomenon known as the myogenic response. Many muscular vessels present vasomotion, i.e., rhythmic diameter oscillations caused by synchronous cytosolic calcium oscillations of the smooth muscle cells. Vasomotion has been shown to be modulated by pressure changes. To get a better understanding of the effect of stress and in particular pressure on vasomotion, we propose a model of a blood vessel describing the calcium dynamics in a coupled population of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells and the consequent vessel diameter variations. We show that a rise in pressure increases the calcium concentration. This may either induce or abolish vasomotion, or increase its frequency depending on the initial conditions. In our model the myogenic response is less pronounced for large arteries than for small arteries and occurs at higher values of pressure if the wall thickness is increased. Our results are in agreement with experimental observations concerning a broad range of vessels.},

In this study, the effect of low concentrations of potassium on the spontaneous tone of resistance-sized isolated posterior cerebral arteries from Wistar-Kyoto rats was examined. At a transmural pressure of approximately 58 mmHg, the vessels developed spontaneous tone that was 69 +/- 2\% of their fully relaxed diameter of 184 +/- 2 microns (n = 50). Introduction of potassium (less than 5 mM) after a 5-min period in potassium-free physiological saline solution resulted in transient dilations, which were not attenuated by barium or cesium but abolished by ouabain. However, potassium concentrations between 7 and 15 mM produced dilations that lacked a transient component and were sensitive to barium, cesium, and ouabain. Maintained dilations to 10 mM K+ persisted in tetrodotoxin, tetraethylammonium, and glibenclamide and after endothelium removal. These results suggest that potassium dilation of cerebral arteries has two independent components, the first of which may be caused by stimulation of the electrogenic sodium pump (0-5 mM K+), whereas the second (greater than 7 mM K+) results from activation of a ouabain-, barium-, and cesium-sensitive process. The latter process describes a means by which potassium may effect prolonged changes in cerebral blood flow.},

Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.},

There is strong clinical and experimental evidence to suggest that CSD is the mechanism of migraine, and involved in progressive neuronal injury in stroke and head trauma. Here we tested the hypothesis that single episodes of CSD induced acute hypoxia, and prolonged impairment of neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling. Cortical spreading depression was induced in rat frontal cortex, whereas cortical electrical activity and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded by glass microelectrodes, cerebral blood flow (CBF) by laser-Doppler flowmetry, and tissue oxygen tension (tpO(2)) with polarographic microelectrodes. Cortical spreading depression increased cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) by 71\%+/-6.7\% and CBF by 238\%+/-48.1\% for 1 to 2 mins. For the following 2 h, basal tpO(2) and CBF were reduced whereas basal CMRO(2) was persistently elevated by 8.1\%+/-2.9\%. In addition, within first hour after CSD we found impaired neurovascular coupling (LFP versus CBF), whereas neurometabolic coupling (LFP versus CMRO(2)) remained unaffected. Impaired neurovascular coupling was explained by both reduced vascular reactivity and suppressed function of cortical inhibitory interneurons. The protracted effects of CSD on basal CMRO(2) and neurovascular coupling may contribute to cellular dysfunction in patients with migraine and acutely injured cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {ONE marked characteristic of the literature dealing with the cerebral circulation is, we think, the contradictory nature of the results which have been obtained by different investigators. There is no reason, we imagine, for doubting that the cause of these discrepancies is to be found in the great difficulty of avoiding the sources of error which plentifully surround the subject, and in overcoming certain technical difficulties which we shall presently have to refer to. The ease with which one can obtain results upon certain points, on taking up the subject, is itself, we believe, apt to make the inquiirer careless in controlling sources of error, which, it may be noted, are some of them not at first sigrht obvious. We must on this account say more about the technology of our subject than would be necessary were the subject a simpler one.},

@article{Traub1994,
abstract = {1. We constructed a branching dendritic compartmental model of a CA3 pyramidal neurone, using experimental data from guinea-pig and rat cells obtained in vitro. The goal was to understand interactions between synaptic events impinging on dendritic branches and voltage- and calcium-dependent currents. The model contained sixty-four soma-dendrite (SD) compartments, an axon initial segment (IS), and four axonal compartments. There were six active conductances in the SD membrane, including a sodium conductance (gNa) and a high-threshold calcium conductance (gCa), with kinetic properties similar to those reported in a previous study. 2. The distribution of conductance densities across the IS and SD was adjusted by testing the model response to antidromic stimulation and current pulses or sustained currents injected into the soma or apical dendrites. As before, gNa was concentrated on and near the soma with lower density in the dendrites, while gCa had a higher density in apical dendrites than at the soma. 3. The model predicts that CA3 pyramidal neurones in media blocking synaptic transmission should fire a burst of action potentials following antidromic stimulation. This was confirmed experimentally in hippocampal slices. 4. Both in the model and in guinea-pig neurones, dendritic IPSCs can delay the onset of bursting. If an IPSC begins soon enough after the first fast action potential, the later burst envelope is attenuated. This effect results from suppression of dendritic Ca2+ electrogenesis. 5. The model predicts that an appropriately timed dendritic IPSC (after the first somatic spike but before the dendritic Ca2+ spike) may suppress the transient local [Ca2+] signal, while having a negligible effect on the electrical output of the neurone. This phenomenon has been reported in guinea-pig Purkinje cells. 6. We conclude that active dendritic currents are critical for regulation of the electrical output of CA3 pyramidal neurones. We suggest also that dendritic [Ca2+] signals might be controlled in individual dendrites independently of action potential outputs, an effect of possible importance for synaptic plasticity.},

@article{Varon1979,
abstract = {The progress of research in the Central Nervous System (CNS) had led to the consideration of neurons and glia as indissociable functional complexes. Neuron-glia interactions are essential for the maturation of the CNS. Glial cells release trophic factors for neurons (NGF) and neurons release trophic factors for glia (GGF). Furthermore, the latter provide a substrate for the migration of neurons and guidance of axons by mean of adhesion molecules. In adults, the interactions between neurons and glial cells serve to maintain homeostasis. Thus, the glial cells perform the restoration of the metabolic equilibrium overthrown by the transmission of the nerve impulse and provide the glucose required for neuronal activity. The nerve impulse provokes increases in the cellular space of CO2, K+, NH3 and neurotransmitters which must be taken up to allow neuronal activity to continue (in normal conditions). Astrocytes perform the uptake of the extracellular K+ by means of passive ionic channels, ionic voltage-dependent channels and a sodium-potassium-ATPase-dependent pump. The oligodendrocytes are involved in the metabolism of CO2 by converting CO2 into carbonic acid by means of carbonic anhydrase. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes play a role in terminating neural transmission by the uptake of the amino acid neurotransmitters, such as GABA, glutamate and aspartate. The catabolism of glutamate to glutamine by means of glutamine synthetase allows both the conversion of an excitatory amino acid into a neutral amino acid (which can diffuse in the extracellular space without causing neural transmission) and the reduction of cerebral NH3 content.},

abstract = {1. The validity of the macroscopic laws of ion diffusion was critically examined within the microenvironment of the extracellular space in the rat cerebellum using ion-selective micropipettes and ionophoretic point sources. 2. The concepts of volume averaging, volume fraction (alpha) and tortuosity (lambda) were defined and shown to be theoretically appropriate for quantifying diffusion in a complex medium such as the brain. 3. Diffusion studies were made with the cations tetramethylammonium and tetraethylammonium and the anions alpha-naphthalene sulphonate and hexafluoro-arsenate, all of which remained essentially extracellular during the measurements. Diffusion parameters were measured for a period of 50s and over distances of the order of 0.1 mm. 4. Measurements of the diffusion coefficients of the ions in agar gel gave values that were very close to those derivable from the literature, thus confirming the validity of the method. 5. Measurements in the cerebellum did not reveal any systematic influences of ionophoretic current strength, electrode separation, anisotropy, inhomogeneity, charge discrimination or uptake, within the limits tested. 6. The pooled data from measurements with all the ions gave alpha = 0.21 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- S.E. of mean) and lambda = 1.55 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- S.E. of mean). 7. These results show that the extracellular space occupies about 20\% of the rat cerebellum and that the diffusion coefficient for small monovalent extracellular ions is reduced by a factor of 2.4 (i.e. lambda 2) without regard to charge sign. The over-all effect of this is to increase the apparent strength of any ionic source in the cerebellum by a factor of lambda 2/alpha, about 12-fold in the present case, and to modify the time course of diffusion. 8. These conclusions confirm that the laws of macroscopic diffusion are closely obeyed in the cerebellum for small ions in the extracellular space, provided that volume fraction and tortuosity are explicitly taken into account. It is likely that these conclusions are generally applicable to other brain regions and other diffusing substances.},

Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.},

abstract = {Glucose had long been thought to fuel oxidative metabolism in active neurons until the recently proposed astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis (ANLSH) challenged this view. According to the ANLSH, activity-induced uptake of glucose takes place predominantly in astrocytes, which metabolize glucose anaerobically. Lactate produced from anaerobic glycolysis in astrocytes is then released from astrocytes and provides the primary metabolic fuel for neurons. The conventional hypothesis asserts that glucose is the primary substrate for both neurons and astrocytes during neural activity and that lactate produced during activity is removed mainly after neural activity. The conventional hypothesis does not assign any particular fraction of glucose metabolism to the aerobic or anaerobic pathways. In this review, the authors discuss the theoretical background and critically review the experimental evidence regarding these two hypotheses. The authors conclude that the experimental evidence for the ANLSH is weak, and that existing evidence and theoretical considerations support the conventional hypothesis.},

abstract = {In vivo studies on frog mesenteric arterioles (4) indicate that segmental differences in the response of microvessels to physical and chemical stimuli can be explained simply in terms of the length-tension characteristics of vascular smooth muscle at different points along the vascular tree. Studies on single, isolated arterioles in vitro were initiated to examine more closely the validity of this explanation for regional response differences. This paper reports some of the results. First-, second-, and third-order arterioles (18-60 micron i.d.) were dissected from hamster cheek pouches. The vessels were cannulated with a modified Burg microperfusion system, and their mechanical properties studied using the methods described by Duling and Gore. Vessels were activated in four stages with K+ and norepinephrine. During activation, transmural pressures were adjusted to minimize vascular smooth-muscle shortening. Active pressure-diameter curves were recorded while adjusting transmural pressure through the range 5 to 400 cm H20 in 5-25 cm steps. Vessel dimensions were measured with a videomicrometer. Passive curves were obtained after equilibration overnight in Ca2+-free medium. The vessels were then fixed and prepared for histologic sectioning, and measurements of vessel-wall composition were made. The Laplace relationship was used to construct length-tension diagrams, and the histologic data were used to normalize the dimensional data to smooth-muscle lengths. Maximum active tension of second-order arterioles (1,170 dynes/cm) was two times previous values reported by Gore et al. This was due presumably to refinements in techniques and dissection procedures. Maximum active stress averaged 3.9 X 10(+6) dynes/cm2 for second-order arterioles. This number is identical to data obtained from hog carotid strips by Dillon et al.},

abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K(+) and the smooth muscle cell Ca(2+) pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca(2+) in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca(2+) can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K(+) SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca(2+) is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca(2+) in NVC, however this Ca(2+) pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

These methods map a specific localized brain activation through a vascular response, such as an increase in cerebral blood flow or a change in blood oxygenation. To understand these direct maps to obtain high resolution maps of localized functional brain activity, a precise knowledge of the specific underlying physiological mechanisms and methodological properties and restrictions is essential. In this article, these fundamental physiological and methodological aspects will be discussed. After reviewing how the techniques cited obtain maps of functional activity, we will discuss our current knowledge of the physiology of coupling with particular reference to the functional imaging techniques.

abstract = {The coupling of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity is well preserved during evolution. Upon changes in the neuronal activity, an incompletely understood coupling mechanism regulates diameter changes of supplying blood vessels, which adjust CBF within seconds. The physiologic brain tissue oxygen content would sustain unimpeded brain function for only 1 second if continuous oxygen supply would suddenly stop. This suggests that the CBF response has evolved to balance oxygen supply and demand. Surprisingly, CBF increases surpass the accompanying increases of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). However, a disproportionate CBF increase may be required to increase the concentration gradient from capillary to tissue that drives oxygen delivery. However, the brain tissue oxygen content is not zero, and tissue pO2 decreases could serve to increase oxygen delivery without a CBF increase. Experimental evidence suggests that CMRO2 can increase with constant CBF within limits and decreases of baseline CBF were observed with constant CMRO2. This conflicting evidence may be viewed as an oxygen paradox of neurovascular coupling. As a possible solution for this paradox, we hypothesize that the CBF response has evolved to safeguard brain function in situations of moderate pathophysiological interference with oxygen supply.},

Energy consumption is several orders of magnitude greater than the thermodynamic minimum. It costs 10(4) ATP molecules to transmit a bit at a chemical synapse, and 10(6)-10(7) ATP for graded signals in an interneuron or a photoreceptor, or for spike coding.

abstract = {Neural activity in the brain is accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation that are detectable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. In this paper, recent mathematical models of this hemodynamic response are reviewed and integrated. Models are described for: (1) the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal as a function of changes in cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (E) and cerebral blood volume (CBV); (2) the balloon model, proposed to describe the transient dynamics of CBV and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and how they affect the BOLD signal; (3) neurovascular coupling, relating the responses in CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) to the neural activity response; and (4) a simple model for the temporal nonlinearity of the neural response itself. These models are integrated into a mathematical framework describing the steps linking a stimulus to the measured BOLD and CBF responses. Experimental results examining transient features of the BOLD response (post-stimulus undershoot and initial dip), nonlinearities of the hemodynamic response, and the role of the physiologic baseline state in altering the BOLD signal are discussed in the context of the proposed models. Quantitative modeling of the hemodynamic response, when combined with experimental data measuring both the BOLD and CBF responses, makes possible a more specific and quantitative assessment of brain physiology than is possible with standard BOLD imaging alone. This approach has the potential to enhance numerous studies of brain function in development, health, and disease.},

In the resting state an excellent correlation (mean r, 0.87) between CBF and CMRO2 was found when paired measurements of CBF and CMRO2 from multiple (30-48) brain regions were tested in each of 33 normal subjects. Regional uncoupling of CBF and CMRO2 was found, however, during neuronal activation induced by somatosensory stimulation. Stimulus-induced focal augmentation of cerebral blood flow (29\% mean) far exceeded the concomitant local increase in tissue metabolic rate (mean, 5\%), when resting-state and stimulated-state measurements were obtained in each of 9 subjects. Stimulus duration had no significant effect on response magnitude or on the degree of CBF-CMRO2 uncoupling observed. Dynamic, physiological regulation of CBF by a mechanism (neuronal or biochemical) dependent on neuronal firing per se, but independent of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, is hypothesized.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that, within a specific cortical unit, fractional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMR(O(2))) are coupled through an invariant relationship during physiological stimulation. This aim was achieved by simultaneously measuring relative changes in these quantities in human primary visual cortex (V1) during graded stimulation with patterns designed to selectively activate different populations of V1 neurons. Primary visual cortex was delineated individually in each subject by using phase-encoded retinotopic mapping. Flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery MRI, in conjunction with blood oxygenation-sensitive MRI and hypercapnic calibration, was used to monitor CBF and CMR(O(2)). The stimuli used included (i) diffuse isoluminant chromatic displays; (ii) high spatial-frequency achromatic luminance gratings; and (iii) radial checkerboard patterns containing both color and luminance contrast modulated at different temporal rates. Perfusion responses to each pattern were graded by varying luminance and/or color modulation amplitudes. For all stimulus types, fractional changes in blood flow and oxygen uptake were found to be linearly coupled in a consistent ratio of approximately 2:1. The most potent stimulus produced CBF and CMR(O(2)) increases of 48 +/- 5\% and 25 +/- 4\%, respectively, with no evidence of a plateau for oxygen consumption. Estimation of aerobic ATP yields from the observed CMR(O(2)) increases and comparison with the maximum possible anaerobic ATP contribution indicate that elevated energy demands during brain activation are met largely through oxidative metabolism.},

abstract = {The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured in the brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an activation experiment often exhibits pronounced transients at the beginning and end of the stimulus. Such transients could be a reflection of transients in the underlying neural activity, or they could result from transients in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), or cerebral blood volume (CBV). These transients were investigated using an arterial spin labeling (ASL) method that allows simultaneous measurements of BOLD and CBF responses. Responses to a finger-tapping task (40-s stimulus, 80-s rest) were measured in primary motor area (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in five healthy volunteers. In SMA, the average BOLD response was pronounced near the beginning and end of the stimulus, while in M1, the BOLD response was nearly flat. However, CBF responses in the two regions were rather similar, and did not exhibit the same transient features as the BOLD response in SMA. Because this suggests a hemodynamic rather than a neural origin for the transients of the BOLD response in SMA, we used a generalization of the balloon model to test the degree of hemodynamic transients required to produce the measured curves. Both data sets could be approximated with modest differences in the shapes of the CMRO2 and CBV responses. This study illustrates the utility and the limitations of using theoretical models combined with ASL techniques to understand the dynamics of the BOLD response. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Increases in extracellular potassium concentration are known to dilate cerebral arterioles. Recent studies have suggested that the potassium released by active neurons is transported through astrocytic glial cells and released from their endfeet onto blood vessels. The results of computer simulations of potassium dynamics in the brain indicate that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet raises perivascular potassium concentration much more rapidly and to higher levels than does diffusion of potassium through extracellular space, particularly when the site of a potassium increase is some distance from the vessel wall. On the basis of this finding, it is proposed that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet plays an important role in regulating regional cerebral blood flow in response to changes in neuronal activity.},

Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.},

In this review, the retinal functional hyperemia response is described, and the cellular mechanisms that may mediate the response are assessed. These neurovascular coupling mechanisms include neuronal stimulation of glial cells, leading to the release of vasoactive arachidonic acid metabolites onto blood vessels, release of potassium from glial cells onto vessels, and production and release of nitric oxide (NO), lactate, and adenosine from neurons and glia. The modulation of neurovascular coupling by oxygen and NO are described, and changes in functional hyperemia that occur with aging and in diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and other pathologies, are reviewed.

Using fMRI, CBV, CBF, neuronal recordings, and CMRO(2) modeling, we investigated how the signals are related during seizures in rats. We found that increases in hemodynamic, neuronal, and metabolic activity were associated with positive BOLD signals in the cortex, but with negative BOLD signals in hippocampus. Our data show that negative BOLD signals do not necessarily imply decreased neuronal activity or CBF, but can result from increased neuronal activity, depending on the interplay between hemodynamics and metabolism. Caution should be used in interpreting fMRI signals because the relationship between neuronal activity and BOLD signals may depend on brain region and state and can be different during normal and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Exposed to a sufficiently high extracellular potassium concentration ([K( + )]₀), the neuron can fire spontaneous discharges or even become inactivated due to membrane depolarisation ('depolarisation block'). Since these phenomena likely are related to the maintenance and propagation of seizure discharges, it is of considerable importance to understand the conditions under which excess [K( + )]₀ causes them. To address the putative effect of glial buffering on neuronal activity under elevated [K( + )](o) conditions, we combined a recently developed dynamical model of glial membrane ion and water transport with a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron model. In this interconnected glia-neuron model we investigated the effects of natural heterogeneity or pathological changes in glial membrane transporter density by considering a large set of models with different, yet empirically plausible, sets of model parameters. We observed both the high [K( + )]₀-induced duration of spontaneous neuronal firing and the prevalence of depolarisation block to increase when reducing the magnitudes of the glial transport mechanisms. Further, in some parameter regions an oscillatory bursting spiking pattern due to the dynamical coupling of neurons and glia was observed. Bifurcation analyses of the neuron model and of a simplified version of the neuron-glia model revealed further insights about the underlying mechanism behind these phenomena. The above insights emphasise the importance of combining neuron models with detailed astroglial models when addressing phenomena suspected to be influenced by the astroglia-neuron interaction. To facilitate the use of our neuron-glia model, a CellML version of it is made publicly available.},

In this study we assessed, for the first time, the differences in neuronal responses and changes in CBF and oxygen consumption that are evoked after the activation of two different inputs to a single cortical area. We show that, for a given level of glutamatergic synaptic activity, corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs evoked activity in pyramidal cells and different classes of interneurons, and produced different changes in oxygen consumption and CBF. Furthermore, increases in stimulation intensities either turned off or activated additional classes of inhibitory interneurons immunoreactive for different vasoactive molecules, which may contribute to increases in CBF. Our data imply that for a given cortical area, the amplitude of vascular signals will depend critically on the type of input, and that a positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal may be a consequence of the activation of both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons.},

abstract = {The haemodynamic responses to neural activity that underlie the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain are often assumed to be driven by energy use, particularly in presynaptic terminals or glia. However, recent work has suggested that most brain energy is used to power postsynaptic currents and action potentials rather than presynaptic or glial activity and, furthermore, that haemodynamic responses are driven by neurotransmitter-related signalling and not directly by the local energy needs of the brain. A firm understanding of the BOLD response will require investigation to be focussed on the neural signalling mechanisms controlling blood flow rather than on the locus of energy use.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging signals are generated, in part, by increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) evoked by mediators, such as nitric oxide and arachidonic acid derivatives that are released in response to increased neurotransmission. However, it is unknown whether the vascular and metabolic responses within a given brain area differ when local neuronal activity is evoked by an activity in the distinct neuronal networks. In this study we assessed, for the first time, the differences in neuronal responses and changes in CBF and oxygen consumption that are evoked after the activation of two different inputs to a single cortical area. We show that, for a given level of glutamatergic synaptic activity, corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs evoked activity in pyramidal cells and different classes of interneurons, and produced different changes in oxygen consumption and CBF. Furthermore, increases in stimulation intensities either turned off or activated additional classes of inhibitory interneurons immunoreactive for different vasoactive molecules, which may contribute to increases in CBF. Our data imply that for a given cortical area, the amplitude of vascular signals will depend critically on the type of input, and that a positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal may be a consequence of the activation of both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the regional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal response to rapid changes in arterial oxygen tension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Functional MR imaging (fMRI) was carried out in five male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with Sodium Pentobarbital. Rats were subjected to different durations of apnea as a rapid, graded, and reversible hypoxic-hypercapnic stimulus. Dynamics of the BOLD signal response were studied on a pixel-by-pixel basis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, third ventricle, and thalamus in the rat brain. RESULTS: Apnea induced a BOLD signal drop in all the brain regions studied, the magnitude of which increased with longer durations of the stimulus. The signal recovered to preapnic baseline levels after resumption of normal ventilation. Regional variation in the BOLD signal dynamics was observed with the magnitude of the BOLD signal change in the hippocampus being the least, followed by a relatively larger change in the thalamus, cerebral cortex, and third ventricle. The time (t(0)) for the signal change after the onset of the stimulus was estimated for every pixel. Time delay maps generated show the highest onset time values in the hippocampus followed by the thalamus, cerebral cortex, and third ventricle. CONCLUSION: The regional dynamics of the BOLD signal in the brain in response to apnea may vary depending on the rate of oxygen metabolism in addition to cerebral blood flow (CBF).},

In addition to increases in cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals, sustained negative responses are pervasive in functional imaging. The origin of negative responses and their relationship to neural activity remain poorly understood. Through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological recording, we demonstrate a negative BOLD response (NBR) beyond the stimulated regions of visual cortex, associated with local decreases in neuronal activity below spontaneous activity, detected 7.15 +/- 3.14 mm away from the closest positively responding region in V1. Trial-by-trial amplitude fluctuations revealed tight coupling between the NBR and neuronal activity decreases. The NBR was associated with comparable decreases in local field potentials and multiunit activity. Our findings indicate that a significant component of the NBR originates in neuronal activity decreases.},

abstract = {From a structural perspective, the predominant glial cell of the central nervous system, the astrocyte, is positioned to regulate synaptic transmission and neurovascular coupling: the processes of one astrocyte contact tens of thousands of synapses, while other processes of the same cell form endfeet on capillaries and arterioles. The application of subcellular imaging of Ca2+ signaling to astrocytes now provides functional data to support this structural notion. Astrocytes express receptors for many neurotransmitters, and their activation leads to oscillations in internal Ca2+. These oscillations induce the accumulation of arachidonic acid and the release of the chemical transmitters glutamate, d-serine, and ATP. Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytic endfeet can control cerebral microcirculation through the arachidonic acid metabolites prostaglandin E2 and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids that induce arteriole dilation, and 20-HETE that induces arteriole constriction. In addition to actions on the vasculature, the release of chemical transmitters from astrocytes regulates neuronal function. Astrocyte-derived glutamate, which preferentially acts on extrasynaptic receptors, can promote neuronal synchrony, enhance neuronal excitability, and modulate synaptic transmission. Astrocyte-derived d-serine, by acting on the glycine-binding site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, can modulate synaptic plasticity. Astrocyte-derived ATP, which is hydrolyzed to adenosine in the extracellular space, has inhibitory actions and mediates synaptic cross-talk underlying heterosynaptic depression. Now that we appreciate this range of actions of astrocytic signaling, some of the immediate challenges are to determine how the astrocyte regulates neuronal integration and how both excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory signals (adenosine) provided by the same glial cell act in concert to regulate neuronal function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extracellular concentration of potassium ion ([K+]o) may have a significant influence on the cerebral circulation in health and disease. Mechanisms of [K+]o-induced conducted vasomotor responses in cerebral arterioles, possibly linking microvascular regulation to neuronal activity, have not been examined. METHODS: We analyzed vascular responses to small increases of [K+]o (up to 5 mmol/L) in isolated, cannulated, and pressurized rat cerebral arterioles (36.5+/-1.4 micro m). [K+]o was elevated globally through extraluminal application or locally through micropipette, while arteriolar diameter was measured online. RESULTS: Elevation of [K+]o (5 mmol/L) produced dilation that was inhibited by ouabain but not BaCl2. Locally applied [K+]o (3 to 5 mmol/L) produced a biphasic response (initial constriction followed by dilation), both of which were conducted to the remote site (distance 1142+/-68 microm). Endothelial impairment inhibited conducted but not local biphasic responses. Extraluminal ouabain attenuated local and conducted secondary dilation but not initial constriction. The local biphasic response was unaffected by extraluminal or intraluminal BaCl2. Extraluminal but not intraluminal BaCl2 impaired both conducted constriction and dilation. CONCLUSIONS: In rat penetrating arteriole, (1) [K+]o (3 to 5 mmol/L) strongly regulates arteriolar tone and causes conducted vasomotor responses; (2) local responses to elevated [K+]o are endothelium independent but conducted responses are dependent on an intact endothelium; (3) smooth muscle Na+-K+-ATPase activation is the generator of conducted dilation; and (4) smooth muscle inward rectifier potassium channels sustain conduction. Our findings suggest that potassium-induced conducted vasomotor responses may link local neuronal activity to microvascular regulation, which may be attenuated in pathological conditions.},

abstract = {The central idea of the oxygen limitation model is that the oxygen extraction fraction E must decrease during neuronal activation, so a large change in cerebral blood flow (CBF) is required to support a small change in the cerebral metabolic rate of O2 (CMRO2). The model is expanded here to show that maintaining mitochondrial pO2 at a constant non-zero level during activation, so that O2 availability does not become limiting for CMRO2, still requires the fractional CBF change to be several times larger than the CMRO2 change. Furthermore, the expanded model also allows for a brief initial increase in E at stimulus onset with a corresponding transient dip in cytoplasm and mitochondrial pO2. However, because the tissue pO2 must increase to support a higher CMRO2, the tissue O2 content itself would be an ambiguous signal for regulating CBF. For this reason, although the function served by a large CBF increase may be to support CMRO2, the tissue O2 content itself is probably not the key factor for regulation of CBF.},

Focal areas of gray matter display an initial negative change in signal intensity that reaches a maximum of 1\% about 2 s after the onset of photic stimulation. This component then changes sign, reaching a positive maximum about 5 s after the onset of the stimulus. Other areas, including those where draining veins are visible, show only a positive signal change, reaching a maximum of about 6\% after the onset of the visual stimulus. These time constants are in very good agreement with published data obtained with intrinsic optical mapping techniques, where a deoxygenation phase has been shown to occur in functionally specific cortical columns, followed by an increase in blood volume which is more distributed in nature. Thus, we believe there is strong evidence that a sensitivity to capillary oxygenation state is present in high S/N functional MR images obtained with EPI at 4 T.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that, within a specific cortical unit, fractional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMR(O(2))) are coupled through an invariant relationship during physiological stimulation. This aim was achieved by simultaneously measuring relative changes in these quantities in human primary visual cortex (V1) during graded stimulation with patterns designed to selectively activate different populations of V1 neurons. Primary visual cortex was delineated individually in each subject by using phase-encoded retinotopic mapping. Flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery MRI, in conjunction with blood oxygenation-sensitive MRI and hypercapnic calibration, was used to monitor CBF and CMR(O(2)). The stimuli used included (i) diffuse isoluminant chromatic displays; (ii) high spatial-frequency achromatic luminance gratings; and (iii) radial checkerboard patterns containing both color and luminance contrast modulated at different temporal rates. Perfusion responses to each pattern were graded by varying luminance and/or color modulation amplitudes. For all stimulus types, fractional changes in blood flow and oxygen uptake were found to be linearly coupled in a consistent ratio of approximately 2:1. The most potent stimulus produced CBF and CMR(O(2)) increases of 48 +/- 5\% and 25 +/- 4\%, respectively, with no evidence of a plateau for oxygen consumption. Estimation of aerobic ATP yields from the observed CMR(O(2)) increases and comparison with the maximum possible anaerobic ATP contribution indicate that elevated energy demands during brain activation are met largely through oxidative metabolism.},

abstract = {This paper provides a brief overview of how we got involved in fMRI work and of our efforts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BOLD signal changes. The phenomenon discussed here in particular is the post-stimulus undershoot (PSU), the interpretation of which has captivated many fMRI scientists and is still under debate to date. This controversy is caused both by the convoluted physiological origin of the BOLD effect, which allows many possible explanations, and the lack of comprehensive data in the early years. BOLD effects reflect changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), volume (CBV), metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and hematocrit fraction (Hct). However, the size of such effects is modulated by vascular origin such as intravascular, extravascular, macro and microvascular, venular and capillary, the relative contributions of which depend not only on the spatial resolution of the measurements, but also on stimulus duration, on magnetic field strength and on whether spin echo (SE) or gradient echo (GRE) detection is used. The two most dominant explanations of the PSU have been delayed vascular compliance (first venular, later arteriolar, and recently capillary) and sustained increases in CMRO2, while post-activation reduction in CBF is a distant third. MRI has the capability to independently measure CBF and arteriolar, venous, and total CBV contributions in humans and animals, which has been of great assistance in improving the understanding of BOLD phenomena. Using currently available MRI and optical data, we conclude that the predominant PSU origin is a sustained increase in CMRO2. However, some contributions from delayed vascular compliance are likely, and small CBF undershoot contributions that are difficult to detect with current arterial spin labeling technology can also not be excluded. The relative contribution of these different processes, which are not mutually exclusive and can act together, is likely to vary with stimulus duration and type. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47\% and 34\%, respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13\%), and glutamate recycling using only 3\%. Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate--an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with <or=15\% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons.

abstract = {Summary: The coupling of electrical activity in the brain to changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) is of interest because hemodynamic changes are used to track brain function. Recent studies, especially those investigating the cerebellar cortex, have shown that the spike rate in the principal target cell of a brain region (i.e. the efferent cell) does not affect vascular response amplitude. Subthreshold integrative synaptic pro- cesses trigger changes in the local microcirculation and local glucose consumption. The spatial specificity of the vascular response on the brain surface is limited because of the func- tional anatomy of the pial vessels. Within the cortex there is a characteristic laminar flow distribution, the largest changes of which are observed at the depth of maximal synaptic activity (i.e. layer IV) for an afferent input system. Under most condi- tions, increases in CBF are explained by activity in postsynap- tic neurons, but presynaptic elements can contribute. Neuro- transmitters do not mediate increases in CBF that are triggered by the concerted action of several second messenger molecules. It is important to distinguish between effective synaptic inhi- bition and deactivation that increase and decrease CBF and glucose consumption, respectively. In summary, hemodynamic changes evoked by neuronal activity depend on the afferent input function (i.e. all aspects of presynaptic and postsynaptic processing), but are totally independent of the efferent function (i.e., the spike rate of the same region). Thus, it is not possible to conclude whether the output level of activity of a region is increased based on brain maps that use blood-flow changes as markers},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to characterizing evoked hemodynamic responses in fMRI based on nonlinear system identification, in particular the use of Volterra series. The approach employed enables one to estimate Volterra kernels that describe the relationship between stimulus presentation and the hemodynamic responses that ensue. Volterra series are essentially high-order extensions of linear convolution or "smoothing." These kernels, therefore, represent a nonlinear characterization of the hemodynamic response function that can model the responses to stimuli in different contexts (in this work, different rates of word presentation) and interactions among stimuli. The nonlinear components of the responses were shown to be statistically significant, and the kernel estimates were validated using an independent event-related fMRI experiment. One important manifestation of these nonlinear effects is a modulation of stimulus-specific responses by preceding stimuli that are proximate in time. This means that responses at high-stimulus presentation rates saturate and, in some instances, show an inverted U behavior. This behavior appears to be specific to BOLD effects (as distinct from evoked changes in cerebral blood flow) and may represent a hemodynamic "refractoriness." The aim of this paper is to describe the theory and techniques upon which these conclusions were based and to discuss the implications for experimental design and analysis.},

abstract = {Functional brain imaging with positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has been used extensively to map regional changes in brain activity. The signal used by both techniques is based on changes in local circulation and metabolism (brain work). Our understanding of the cell biology of these changes has progressed greatly in the past decade. New insights have emerged on the role of astrocytes in signal transduction as has an appreciation of the unique contribution of aerobic glycolysis to brain energy metabolism. Likewise our understanding of the neurophysiologic processes responsible for imaging signals has progressed from an assumption that spiking activity (output) of neurons is most relevant to one focused on their input. Finally, neuroimaging, with its unique metabolic perspective, has alerted us to the ongoing and costly intrinsic activity within brain systems that most likely represents the largest fraction of the brain's functional activity.},

@article{Kager2002,
abstract = {In spite of five decades of study, the biophysics of spreading depression (SD) is incompletely understood. Earlier we have modeled seizures and SD, and we have shown that currents through ion channels normally present in neuron membranes can generate SD-like depolarization. In the present study, we define the conditions for triggering SD and the parameters that influence its course in a model of a hippocampal pyramidal cell with more complete representation of ions and channels than the previous version. "Leak" conductances for Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) and an ion pump were present in the membrane of the entire cell; fast inactivating voltage dependent conductances for sodium and potassium in the soma; "persistent" conductances in soma and apical dendrite, and K(+)- and voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-controlled conductance in the apical dendrite. The neuron was surrounded by restricted interstitial space and by a "glia-endothelium" system of extracellular ion regulation bounded by a membrane having leak conductances and an ion pump. Ion fluxes and concentration changes were continuously computed as well as osmotic cell volume changes. As long as reuptake into the neuron and "buffering" by glia kept pace with K(+) released from the neuron, stimulating current applied to the soma evoked repetitive firing that stopped when stimulation ceased. When glial uptake was reduced, K(+) released from neurons could accumulate in the interstitium and keep the neuron depolarized so that strong depolarizing pulses injected into the soma were followed either by afterdischarge or SD. SD-like depolarization was ignited when depolarization spreading into the apical dendrite, activated persistent Na(+) current and NMDA-controlled current. With membrane parameters constant, varying the injected stimulating current influenced SD onset but neither the depolarization nor the increase in extracellular K(+). Glial "leak" conductance influenced SD duration and SD ignition point. Varying maximal conductances (representing channel density) also influenced SD onset time but not the amplitude of the depolarization. Hypoxia was simulated by turning off the Na-K exchange pump, and this resulted in SD-like depolarization. The results confirm that, once ignited, SD runs an all-or-none trajectory, the level of depolarization is governed by feedback involving ion shifts and glutamate acting on ion channels and not by the number of channels open, and SD is ignited if the net persistent membrane current in the apical dendrites turns inward.},

abstract = {The coupling of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity is well preserved during evolution. Upon changes in the neuronal activity, an incompletely understood coupling mechanism regulates diameter changes of supplying blood vessels, which adjust CBF within seconds. The physiologic brain tissue oxygen content would sustain unimpeded brain function for only 1 second if continuous oxygen supply would suddenly stop. This suggests that the CBF response has evolved to balance oxygen supply and demand. Surprisingly, CBF increases surpass the accompanying increases of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). However, a disproportionate CBF increase may be required to increase the concentration gradient from capillary to tissue that drives oxygen delivery. However, the brain tissue oxygen content is not zero, and tissue pO2 decreases could serve to increase oxygen delivery without a CBF increase. Experimental evidence suggests that CMRO2 can increase with constant CBF within limits and decreases of baseline CBF were observed with constant CMRO2. This conflicting evidence may be viewed as an oxygen paradox of neurovascular coupling. As a possible solution for this paradox, we hypothesize that the CBF response has evolved to safeguard brain function in situations of moderate pathophysiological interference with oxygen supply.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study the operational organization of the human brain, but the exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.},

Here we show in rat cortical slices that the dilation of arterioles triggered by neuronal activity is dependent on glutamate-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in astrocytes. Inhibition of these Ca(2+) responses resulted in the impairment of activity-dependent vasodilation, whereas selective activation--by patch pipette--of single astrocytes that were in contact with arterioles triggered vessel relaxation. We also found that a cyclooxygenase product is centrally involved in this astrocyte-mediated control of arterioles. In vivo blockade of glutamate-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) elevations in astrocytes reduced the blood flow increase in the somatosensory cortex during contralateral forepaw stimulation. Taken together, our findings show that neuron-to-astrocyte signaling is a key mechanism in functional hyperemia.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in alternative brain imaging technologies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains the workhorse for both medical diagnosis and primary research. Indeed, the number of research articles that utilise fMRI have continued to rise unabated since its conception in 1991, despite the limitation that recorded signals originate from the cerebral vasculature rather than neural tissue. Consequently, understanding the relationship between brain activity and the resultant changes in metabolism and blood flow (neurovascular coupling) remains a vital area of research. In the past, technical constraints have restricted investigations of neurovascular coupling to cortical sites and have led to the assumption that coupling in non-cortical structures is the same as in the cortex, despite the lack of any evidence. The current study investigated neurovascular coupling in the rat using whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and multi-channel electrophysiological recordings and measured the response to a sensory stimulus as it proceeded through brainstem, thalamic and cortical processing sites - the so-called whisker-to-barrel pathway. We found marked regional differences in the amplitude of BOLD activation in the pathway and non-linear neurovascular coupling relationships in non-cortical sites. The findings have important implications for studies that use functional brain imaging to investigate sub-cortical function and caution against the use of simple, linear mapping of imaging signals onto neural activity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Normal brain function depends critically on moment-to-moment regulation of oxygen supply by the bloodstream to meet changing metabolic needs. Neurovascular coupling, a range of mechanisms that converge on arterioles to adjust local cerebral blood flow (CBF), represents our current framework for understanding this regulation. We modeled the combined effects of CBF and capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTTH) on the maximum oxygen extraction fraction (OEF(max)) and metabolic rate of oxygen that can biophysically be supported, for a given tissue oxygen tension. Red blood cell velocity recordings in rat brain support close hemodynamic-metabolic coupling by means of CBF and CTTH across a range of physiological conditions. The CTTH reduction improves tissue oxygenation by counteracting inherent reductions in OEF(max) as CBF increases, and seemingly secures sufficient oxygenation during episodes of hyperemia resulting from cortical activation or hypoxemia. In hypoperfusion and states of blocked CBF, both lower oxygen tension and CTTH may secure tissue oxygenation. Our model predicts that disturbed capillary flows may cause a condition of malignant CTTH, in which states of higher CBF display lower oxygen availability. We propose that conditions with altered capillary morphology, such as amyloid, diabetic or hypertensive microangiopathy, and ischemia-reperfusion, may disturb CTTH and thereby flow-metabolism coupling and cerebral oxygen metabolism.},

This work reports results from three empirical tests that support this hypothesis. First, fMRI responses in human primary visual cortex (V1) depend separably on stimulus timing and stimulus contrast. Second, responses to long-duration stimuli can be predicted from responses to shorter duration stimuli. Third, the noise in the fMRI data is independent of stimulus contrast and temporal period. Although these tests can not prove the correctness of the linear transform model, they might have been used to reject the model. Because the linear transform model is consistent with our data, we proceeded to estimate the temporal fMRI impulse–response function and the underlying (presumably neural) contrast–response function of human V1.},

abstract = {The coupling between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) during brain activation can be characterized by an empirical index n, the ratio of fractional CBF changes to fractional CMRO2 changes. Measurements of n have yielded varying results, and it is not known if the observed variability is due to measurement techniques or underlying physiology. The calibrated BOLD approach using hypercapnia offers a promising tool for assessing changes in CBF/CMRO2 coupling in health and disease, but potential systematic errors have not yet been characterized. The goal of this study was to experimentally evaluate the magnitude of bias in the estimate of n that arises from the way in which a region of interest (ROI) is chosen for averaging data and to relate this potential bias to a more general theoretical consideration of the sources of systematic errors in the calibrated BOLD experiment. Results were compared for different approaches for defining an ROI within the visual cortex based on: (1) retinotopically defined V1; (2) a functional CBF localizer; and (3) a functional BOLD localizer. Data in V1 yielded a significantly lower estimate of n (2.45) compared to either CBF (n = 3.45) or BOLD (n = 3.18) localizers. Different statistical thresholds produced biases in estimates of n with values ranging from 3.01 (low threshold) to 4.37 (high threshold). Possible sources of the observed biases are discussed. These results underscore the importance of a critical evaluation of the methodology, and the adoption of consistent standards for applying the calibrated BOLD approach to the evaluation of CBF/CMRO2 coupling. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model neglects the time-dependence of ion concentrations in spiking dynamics. The dynamics is therefore limited to a time scale of milliseconds, which is determined by the membrane capacitance multiplied by the resistance of the ion channels, and by the gating time constants. We study slow dynamics in an extended HH framework that includes time-dependent ion concentrations, pumps, and buffers. Fluxes across the neuronal membrane change intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, whereby the latter can also change through contact to reservoirs in the surroundings. Ion gain and loss of the system is identified as a bifurcation parameter whose essential importance was not realized in earlier studies. Our systematic study of the bifurcation structure and thus the phase space structure helps to understand activation and inhibition of a new excitability in ion homeostasis which emerges in such extended models. Also modulatory mechanisms that regulate the spiking rate can be explained by bifurcations. The dynamics on three distinct slow times scales is determined by the cell volume-to-surface-area ratio and the membrane permeability (seconds), the buffer time constants (tens of seconds), and the slower backward buffering (minutes to hours). The modulatory dynamics and the newly emerging excitable dynamics corresponds to pathological conditions observed in epileptiform burst activity, and spreading depression in migraine aura and stroke, respectively.},
